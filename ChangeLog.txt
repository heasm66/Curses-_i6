Changes between r16 to r18
==========================

* r18 use a never version of the parser library, 6/11 instead of 5/12. This leads to some minor differences.
	THEM instead of IT for objects with attribute pluralname.
	Some small differences in how words are inferred.
	
* The turns counter in the statusline starts at 0 instead of 1.

* Only rooms inside the house have walls (that can be pushed...).

* LIE outside of Servant's Room and Allison's Writing Room now prints "Whatever happened to truthfulness...".

* Only giving Joshua Meldrewe the wishbone will stop the timer that eventually kills you here (in r16 you could give
  him anything and get unlimited time).
  
* Fixed that you with prety statusline always get the "death by bear" message when stumbling around in darkness.

* Fixed missing CR in message when returning back up through the chimney from the priest's hole.

* You only get points for picking up the smooth round stone the first time. In r16 you could get 554 points because
  you got awarded points for the stone two times.
  
* In r16 you can ask Old Evans (when he's hypnotized) for the cresent moon over and over again and he obediently 
  hands you the Moon each time.
  
* In r16, even when the bomb is defused and hidden under the table, the message that the timer is ticking down is
  still repeated every turn you are in the ruined castle cafe.
  
* Added an IFID for this version, F8E04F39-A71B-47E4-88CF-E73BF35775FE.
  
* The coal bunker door/metal door now also can be locked/unlocked from the outside.

* The tight door in the servant's room now have messages when player is trying to open or close it.
