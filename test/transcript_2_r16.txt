It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That tourist map of Paris must be up here somewhere in all this clutter, even if it has been five years since your last trip. And it's your own fault. It looks as if your great-grandfather was the last person to tidy up these lofts...

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

>verbose. i. x biscuit. x torch. x paper
CURSES is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

You are carrying:
  a chocolate biscuit
  an electric torch (providing light and closed)
  a crumpled piece of paper

Oatmeal covered with plain chocolate, since you ask.

The torch has a battery compartment which can be reached by opening it up.

   Things to do:

   1. Find map
   2. Phone airport to check parking
   3. Health forms...

and so on. Let's face it, 1. is more enticing than the rest put together.

>[ Four be the things I'd been better without:
  Love, curiosity, freckles and doubt.

x teachests. look in them
Open-topped. You could easily look inside, if so minded.

That was the first place you tried, hours and hours ago now, and there's nothing there but that boring old book. You pick it up anyway, bored as you are.

>[ What you don't know would make a great book.

x book. look up Peter in History. look up me in History
It was to have been the Honourable Peter Meldrew's life's work, a two-volume edition giving the definitive family history. Unfortunately, although he claimed to have hunted for evidence to the ends of the earth, he never could find a detail he wanted for volume I, and it was never published. Somehow, this typifies your family, and consulting this worthy book about your ancestors makes you realise what an uncanny knack they had for never quite achieving anything.

Unless, of course, you count having an awful lot of children. So many Meldrews are listed here that you'll have to look them up individually.

Modestly, the author (died 1940 or so?) missed himself out.

Perhaps you may one day earn a place in vol. III.

>[ It has always seemed to me that I had to answer
  questions which fate had posed to my forefathers,
  and which had not yet been answered, or as if I
  had to complete, or perhaps continue, things which
  previous ages had left unfinished.

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

>x cupboard
In the scratched cupboard are a bird whistle, a gift-wrapped parcel and a guaranteed-unbreakable medicine bottle with a child-proof lock.

>x whistle. x parcel. x bottle
A patent "Harrison" bird-whistle, according to the slogan on one side.

You see nothing special about the gift-wrapped parcel.

"Antidote only: no preventative effect."

Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.

Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.

Great Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambezi Expedition of 1882!

>take rucksack. x it
Taken.

On second thoughts, now you look at more closely, it seems to be the rucksack you bought to go to Paris with five years ago.

>look up Ebenezer in History
It seems Ebenezer (1846-1908), the younger of a pair of twins, threw up a promising career in the East India Company one day, took a packet steamer to Cape Colony and simply marched off into the bush on a quest to find a legendary river. His maps were used for several years after, and a province was named after him for a while, but the locals call it something else now.

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.

As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?

>x demijohn
Faded ink on the label reads: Elderberry '63.

The good news is that it has excellent grid references, which are easy to look up. The bad news is that it is a map of central Hamburg.

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

Airing Cupboard
A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.

This light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.

A pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.

Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.

>x Jemima
She's been fiddling about with those cut flowers all afternoon. And she's a bit upset at being left alone in the house while you're off on holiday, so best not to get on her bad side. You really ought to make it up to her somehow.

Storage Room
A disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on.

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.

Servant's Room
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

There's a little book on the tiny bedside table.

An old striped scarf hangs up behind the doorway.

>get on bed. sleep
You get onto the camp bed.

You sleep unexpectedly deeply, but just as you think you are starting to wake up, you experience a sudden...

Premonition
It is a frosty, clear night, but there is a scent of camp-fires burning in the distance. You are passing through the landscape as if a ghost, and all seems faintly unreal. To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen.

>i
You are carrying nothing.

>e. n
You pass uncomfortably straight through the hide wall.

The General's Tent
This is the tent of a thin, reedy man who wears no uniform but has an obvious and commanding presence. He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their distance from a trestle table at the north end of the tent.


Shrine of the Bear
This is a kind of improvised shrine. A trestle table bears entrails, crude drawings sketched out on hide, and caged animals: draped beside it is a primitive tapestry of a bear reared up on its hind legs.

On the table is a heavy iron mascot of some kind.

Beside the table is a more substantial adviser, as if she too walks in this strange spirit plane. She is wearing frightening druidical robes, of strange pelts and furs, with nasty-looking charms around her neck. Every so often, she seems to catch sight of you out of the corner of her eye, but then look round and see nothing. The military men do not believe in her power, and yet... they treat her with respect.

>x Druid. x mascot. x bear
You see nothing special about Druid.

The mascot is in the shape of an ankh, with a lemniscus (or infinity) symbol moulded onto it.

Primal, bestial, terrifying.

>take mascot
The Druid catches sight of your ghostly hand taking the mascot, and immediately begins her occultations, cursing you and your ill-gotten gains. But she is unable to make contact with you, and turns furiously to the tapestry, hissing "lagach" to the Bear. At once a sudden swirl of wind seems to pull her into the rough cloth, dissolving her to nothing.

>lagach
You feel inexplicably powerful, but nothing happens. Perhaps you should have addressed yourself more precisely.

Dropped.

Premonition
It is a frosty, clear night, but there is a scent of camp-fires burning in the distance. You are passing through the landscape as if a ghost, and all seems faintly unreal. To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen.


Camp Fire
You can almost smell fear here. A motley platoon of soldiers are sitting about the embers of a fire. None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it.


Near Dolmen
A standing stone, perhaps a glacial erratic, stands here and on top of it is a shining blue stone, whose brightness almost blinds you. You feel irresistably drawn to it, and your hand reaches out...

You awaken, shivering with dread.

>stand. w. s. se. w

Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

Austin purrs and licks one of his paws.


Dark Room
This is a roughly-furnished photographer's dark room, used by your grandfather years ago. There's nothing much here now, since you threw the chemicals out in case the children found them.

Mounted on a plaque is an old sepia photograph of a man.

You bump your head on the cord hanging from the ceiling, for the umpteenth time.

A rather more modern photographer's flash lies on a shelf to one side.

>pull cord
Click!  A developing lamp comes on, emitting an eerie red light.

Austin sidles in from the east landing.

>x plaque. look up Roger in History
The photograph is one of the very early ones which looks as if it was taken in the dark because the chemicals have gradually oxidised. The poor man in the frame (Mr Roger Meldrew, Esquire) looks as if he was propped up by a big clamp to hold him still for five minutes, and that's because he was.

Austin jumps up at the cord, but falls back down again, growling.

Roger (1846-1913), the elder of a pair of twins, was very Victorian indeed, especially in his disapproval of his beautiful young wife's literary career. He thought her romances so immoral that he refused to allow the family name to appear on them. A prominent local vestryman, his own writing was confined to a great many monographs on the problems of municipal drainage, but he died before his grand National Sewerage Plan was complete.

>x flash. take it
The kind of black box which often sits on top of a camera, used to illuminate otherwise dim scenes. It has an openable compartment on the side, with room left inside for a battery and a timer mechanism (which seem to be optional extras).

Austin ambles in from the dark room.


Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

>x detector
It isn't at all clear on what principle the detector works. It looks like a smoke detector, certainly. But you just left the contractors to sort out all those boring fire prevention matters for themselves.

They were a slap-dash firm, too, from what you remember. They put the little white thing high up, right in the middle of the Capricorn scene on the mural. And even if there was a fire, chances are it would be useless.

Library Storage
Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.

A romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books left, and they're propping up a water pipe near a rather loose joint - it really is time you called a plumber to sort this one out.

>take wrench. tighten joint
(putting the classical dictionary into the canvas rucksack to make room)
It's a wrench, but you take it.

You tighten the joint with the wrench, just enough for the books to fall away without a gushing explosion of water.

look up Alison in History
Under the pseudonym Marie Swelldon, your ancestress Alison (1871-1930) wrote several mildly successful romances. She obsessively collected lucky charms, and advertised in newspapers for double-headed coins and the like (although she never traced a rumoured find of a five-leafed clover, somewhere in County Donegal).

In order to write in tranquillity and to avoid her husband, it was she who installed the fake wall at the far south end of the attic east wing, and each afternoon she would sneak upstairs to push it aside.

Shadowy Hallway
This shambolic flat, extending to the east, shares a filthy hallway with the one upstairs. To the south, passers-by pass by along the street. Peeling-away posters have been stuck up on top of each other on the walls, in such a way that you can only read the most recent.

Bohemia
Flats occupied by starving-but-noble artists can be romantic and stylish despite the squalor. This one, however, is simply a one-room hovel, caked with paint, littered with brushes and improvised easels, and you can't help standing on tiptoe here.

One whole wall is an Impressionist mural painting of a chateau in Aix-en-Provence.

>x mural. look up Helene in History
The bottom corner is signed simply "Helene".

Helene Meldrew (1902-) is a noted painter and sculptress. Her relations with the family were broken off in the 20s when she married Anton and ran off to Paris to study art, but she has recently returned to the House, in search (as she puts it) of "the perfect blue, the blue of the sky, the blue of water". We wish her well.

>look up Anton in History
Anton Smyslov shouldn't really be in the book, even if he did marry Helene, but there is a brief passage, since he was so famous - he was a chess grandmaster, and won the Paris Open five years running in the 1930s. His speciality was bold sacrificial attacks, but he was also notorious for eating blueberry yoghurt at the board.

Consulting Room
The stairs end at a shabby room, with screened windows, lit by incense sticks and sevenbranched candelabra. A doorway with a hanging bead curtain leads west. In the centre of the room is a table, on which is an electric bell push and a wicked Tarot pack.

>x bell. x Tarot. w
You see nothing special about the bell push.

The cards defy mortal examination.

Peculiarly, the hanging curtain seems to be solid iron when you walk into it.

>push bell
Madame Sosostris, the famous clairvoyante, breezes in through the hanging curtain and sits behind the table, making waving gestures with her hands.

"First, this I must know, were you born in an even, or an odd, year?"

>say odd
(to Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante)
Madame Sosostris picks up the cards and deals them onto the table. She frowns in concentration as the Grim Reaper, the Fool and then the Drowned Sailor show. She blanches with alarm, then recovers and jabbers something about not taking the cards too literally, the images being symbolic and so on. As rapidly as she possibly can, she warns you to fear death by water and then hustles you out onto the street.

Madame Sosostris breezes in once more. "You again," she says warily. "Let us see how your fortunes have changed."

Madame Sosostris picks up the cards and deals them onto the table. She frowns in concentration as the King of Stones, the One-Eyed Merchant and then the Queen of Cups show. "Curse it, another nobody," she hisses in an unguarded moment, as she tidies the pack absentmindedly with her hands. Then she recovers her poise and advises about handsome strangers, fearing death by water, crossing palms with gold and so on. Eventually she ushers you out.

Drifting through the streets from some distant bar comes the sound of one of Scott Joplin's newfangled piano pieces, accompanying song settings from "Romeo and Juliet".


Down by River
Down at the end of the street, the brown urban waters carry by unpleasant rubbish, and rats scuttle up and over the mounds washed up around you.

On one especially repellent mound is, of all things, a fine silk handkerchief.

On the far bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat. As much as you like to explore, you can't see how to attract its attention.

>enter boat

On board the Phlebas
A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore to the east. At the helm is a very strange man, at times almost a straw dummy, almost perhaps a hollow cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and casts his eyes to windward.

The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a real place, like anywhere was real... We are the hollow men, I says, he didn't like that... Hurry up, please, it's time."

>answer time
(to the hollow man)
You lose all sense of time and place as the boat drifts down river... It comes as a considerable relief to your befuddled nerves when the man helps you off the boat again, and you find yourself:

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose loading door is shut.

Was any of that real? you wonder, as you relax in the sunshine. But then you realise you are clutching a tarot card which certainly is.

Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden least visible from the house.

Prominent amongst these is a plaster statuette, a bust of a woman.

This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.

Now, this takes a little explaining... These days, it isn't easy to keep up a house the size of Meldrew Hall, and your family has had to strike a bargain with the National Trust that the house should be open to the public in the summer months. The maze is so popular with visitors that the grass has worn away, and it's being reseeded at the moment, so you shouldn't go treading all over it.

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose loading door is shut.


Beside the Wall
The east-west path along the foot of Meldrew Hall ends here at one of the carved walls bordering the garden.

A shrub is being nursed in a wide round tub in the centre of the path, sheltered behind the wall.

>x shrub. x wall
You see nothing special about the potted shrub.

(the stone wall)
The garden wall once bore painted carvings, but they have fallen into disrepair.

>push tub
Pushing the shrub a little aside reveals an unsightly old timber hatch, about three feet in diameter.

>open hatch. d
The timber lid stands open beside the shrub, revealing the old barrel-hatch.


Wine Cellars
The wine cellars are now quite badly stocked, many of the hexagonal racks being home only to woodlice now. Much of what there is was laid in by your father and has corked. The barrel-shaft slants upwards to the north, and bright light floods in from the gardens above.

Cobwebbed old cellars. There is nothing to see except an opening in one wall onto a dark shaft, and a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel beside it with a handle on. The cellar continues east-to-west and south.

There is a little closed window-vent low in the north wall.

In one corner is a dust-covered robot mouse.

>x vent. x mouse
You can just make out an impression of golden light.

Remember the late 1970s, when a craze for home-made robots swept the home computing world?  No, perhaps not, but here is a left-over from it anyway. The mouse is quite large (almost a foot wide and tall), and has a big smile painted on its metal chassis. It has surprisingly modern circuitry in, though, and is even humming very faintly, so someone must have put some work in on it recently.

The mouse runs off as ordered.

Cellars South
The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is a hole about ten or eleven inches across in the west wall. You peer at this with interest but nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you.

You can see a robot mouse here.

The mouse just squeezes through the hole, and disappears from view. Unfortunately you can't very easily talk to it now...

Hellish Place
Hell, you always imagined, would contain fiery, sulphurous pits and a great many gentlemen with forked tails. You were right about the last part. A demon is sitting behind a flame-proofed desk at the bottom of the stairs. There are some disconcerting screams from further away, but nothing to worry about. Not in this life, anyway.

"Good afternoon," says the demon with a memorable smile. "As a reward for your naked greed, may I welcome you to our little information service. We try to be as helpful as possible to explorers who are lost, or can't think how to solve their problems, you know the kind of thing. So just tell me what you want to know, or show me something to look at. You get the usual three hints."

This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is empty) here.

The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A pleasantly furnished, if now mildewed, box room. There are engravings of Alison's heroines: Christina Rossetti, Elizabeth Browning, Emily Dickinson and Queen Victoria, an unlikely quartet. The wallpaper is done out in a dice motif, and a square outline of sixes surrounds a rather small door leading back north into the attics.

>x painting. look up Isaac in History
It used to hang in the downstairs landing, and the red, deranged eyes annoyed everybody who passed. Then Aunt Jemima picked up the ridiculous idea that it was by Sir Joshua Reynolds and had it valued. Happily it wasn't and, to cut a long story long, it ended up here.

Mad Isaac (1705-1792) went in for mystic experiments of all kinds, and was a noted antiquarian. He believed that the Meldrew family had an ancestral curse, dooming each member to undertake a futile quest. The only way to break the curse, he thought, was for one of them to actually succeed... unfortunately he died in peculiar circumstances before finding out how.

Then again, he also believed that King Arthur's wizard Merlin was buried not in a Tintagel cave, as is usually claimed, but somewhere in the back garden (near where the motorway is now), and that the moon is a giant pair of black and white discs towed through the night sky by a team of angels.

Roof
This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below. There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south.


Battlements
The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.

It is peculiarly cold here.

As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, into a ghostly head which opens its mouth and eats up the key!  The rest of the ghostly body solidifies about the head and rises to swagger before you.

The ghost laughs in a gurgling kind of way, as it were always coughing and spluttering.

Can this possibly be the infamous Sir Joshua Meldrewe?

>look up Joshua in History
Oh dear, the deeply regrettable Sir Joshua Meldrewe (1710-1776). Member of the Dilletanti Society and the Hell-Fire Club, and a politician (chancellor of the exchequer 1762-3; "probably the least competent minister ever to hold that office" - Oxford History of England, vol. xii).

His father disinherited him for wildly excessive living (he almost invariably wore jewelled buttons worth at least a thousand pounds) and for marrying a lady of easy virtue while on the run from a prison in France, where he was sentenced to be beheaded. In order to stop his sister getting the fortune, he went back to Italy and advertised for a pregnant bride to provide a male heir. This nefarious plot was foiled when he choked to death on a chicken-bone.

It is said that he stole the money anyway near the end, and certainly some gold went missing. (He also managed to get the family stripped of its baronetcy by cheating at piquet with the Prince of Wales.)

"But not yet it hasn't, mark my word. And there's the burden of my inheritance, little wart! Get thee from my sight ere I slice thee as befits a hog!"

>give wishbone to Joshua

The ghost swallows the wishbone, grinning nastily. Then a look of consternation spreads across his face. He begins to choke and as he fades away, his arms flailing wildly, he lets go of the key, which sails through the air onto the roof and (against all odds) falls neatly down a chimney.

In 1792, the last year of his life, ol' red-eyes becomes very excited about his new discovery. This time he claims that Merlyn bounde uppe the mystic estate (by this he means the back garden - Isaac never did have any sense of proportion) wyth great Roddes of Power. These are dangerous, yet also useful in themselves, but are really part of a great key... the usual nonsense. Of course you never actually see these rods, because they disguise themselves until waved by someone wearing Merlyn's hat.

The funny thing is that Isaac died (legend has it, by spontaneous combustion) only a week after this breakthrough, preventing him from sending yet another paper to the Royal Society. But since Merlyn supposedly lived in about the sixth century A.D., there can't be a lot left of his hat, so the matter may be academic.

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to go is back up to the observatory.

It has an on/off switch on the side, and a slot for holding whatever is to be projected. There is also a little dial on the back, perhaps for the focus.
The slide projector is currently switched off.

Cups and Glasses
This basement room is filled with crate after crate of glasses and cups, enough for an entire hotel, or restaurant perhaps. Almost anything might be hidden among them. A little light comes in from an opaque skylight which is at street level outdoors. There is no way out of here, since the only door is shut tight.

An unlabelled whisky bottle, laid on its side and mounted on a wood plaque, lies deservedly unwanted on one of the crates.

There is a scuffling noise as some people gather up on the pavement outside the skylight.

Old, unwanted, dusty, empty.

The men begin to talk like conspirators, but half in chants. You catch occasional sounds, but can make little sense of them.

(putting the old smudged battery into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

Alarmingly, you catch the odd word "incendiary" and are almost sure you can make out someone say "accursed Meldrew" (in the old-fashioned way, you know, so that "accursed" rhymes with "dead"). Paranoia, bound to be. There surely can't really be a conspiracy of druid-worshippers out to get you?

>x door
Through the square window in the door you can see a bar at which staff are serving, and a very crowded and lively cafe-restaurant beyond. The cabaret act has her back to you, and a considerable amount of her front to the diners.

"The prophecy must be fulfilled!" one warns, in an unearthly voice which suddenly carries. The others hush him.

A superb model sailing ship, about six inches from prow to stern, immaculate in every detail from an anchor on a filigree chain to a carved mermaid up front.

As you pull the anchor chain, the masts fold inwards and the decks concertina back, until you're holding no more than a tight bundle of sticks.

>put sticks in mounted bottle
The bundle of sticks will just fit through the bottle's neck. With a sudden spring, just as the last of the stick passes the neck, its masts fold out... and you have put the ship into the bottle.

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>x ship
You look very closely at the fine detail on the model sailing ship. Perhaps it's the distorting glass of the bottle, perhaps your romantic imagination, but the deck seems more detailed, the rigging might almost be swaying, the little figure by one mast might almost be alive...

In fact, the closer you look the more sea-sick you feel.

Thank heavens for the deck rail, something to hang on to while this moment of queasiness passes.

>look. fore

Aboard Ship
There is a storm tossing the deck, one which drives no rain: you reel from one side to the other, hanging onto the rail, grabbing at the mast or the rigging. Nobody else seems to be aboard. The boat makes no headway in a strange, glassy mist.

The mast rises dizzyingly high.

You can't even make out the water below. A great pink haze spreads across the sky. With omens like these, who needs albatrosses?


Prow of the Lady Magdalena
You stand in the triangular prow of the ship, which is graced by a carved and painted figurine and named the "Lady Magdalena". There is no sign of water, but the boat is rocked too often for it to be aground. And the glassy mist hangs ahead.

In the Lady Magdalena's loose grip is a traditional sailor's good-luck token: a green-leafed branch, to attract the gulls of an approaching shore.

Up the Mast
Coming up here must be one of your less inspired ideas. The mist is all around you, confusing your senses. Two pale, bluish moons hang in a pink sky.

A flagpole juts out portwards from the top of the mast, far too insubstantial to bear any weight. From it hangs the ensign of the British Merchant Navy (which you could just reach the bottom of).

>x flag. take it
Broad, heavy, scarlet cloth, halfway between a silken sheet and a carpet, with a cross and a Union Jack in one corner.

You take hold of the tassels of the flag in one hand (though it won't pull away from the pole).

>x pole
The flagpole juts out to port with the prevailing... wind?

>port
You wander out onto the flagpole, which bows and bends alarmingly, until suddenly...

Crack!  And you are falling... but gracefully, as the flag billows out into a parachute, until it suddenly tears out of your hand and you come down in an ignominious heap.

Stern
The square stern of the ship looks out south, not onto receding waves, but to what seems a tunnel through dense, glassy mist. You can faintly make out an odd, pale reddish sand bank in the distance.

The top of the anchor chain is wound around the capstan, a great wheel on the deck beside you. The chain disappears over the side.

>turn wheel
You heave away at the capstan, unwinding the great anchor chain.

>climb chain
You shin down the anchor chain, down, down, under the keel of the Lady Magdalena, down until there is nothing but the glassy mist and the endless chain...

...And the approaching soft, spongy, pinkish sand-bank, which welcomes you with its warmth: you step ashore, and immediately sink into the clammy, living sand, until you are engulfed altogether... and pass out.

However, the hard attic floorboards beneath your back soon wake you again.

A ghostly apparition of a venerable man hazes into view. He raises his mahogany staff and strikes it (silently) on the ground, then points it at the walls, and suddenly a flurry of green luminescence chases around you!

Halfway up, or else halfway down, and a dreary place it is too: nothing but a dark corridor leading north.

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.

After a brief ecstasy of fumbling, you pull it on. It smells unpleasantly of World War II leftover cork.

A passage which slants very slightly down to the south, which is full of coal dust, to which you are unfortunately allergic. Not somewhere to linger.

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

The Octagon
A broad, dark octagonal room devoted to dull exhibits of the disastrous Nile Valley Expedition of '21 - the few good ones were donated to the British Museum. A back staircase leads west to the unbuilt extension, while the entrance seems to be the cobwebbed passage southeast. High windows on the northern face let in dim light.

There is a little window-vent high in the southwest wall.

A rather morbid, gilded model coffin rests here in peace.

Halfway up the Stairs
This dark, steep staircase zigzagging through the house once gave the servants access throughout. But those days are long gone and now all the doors are locked up.

The staircase leads up into...

Servant's Room
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

A tight door stands open in the northern wall, giving onto the servants' staircase.

>w. s. se.

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.


Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.


Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south, and hits the glass ball, which diffracts it into a beautiful spectrum across the ceiling.

Austin yawns.


Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to go is back up to the observatory.

You can see a ship in a bottle here.

Your footfall causes the crystal ball to wobble fractionally, just enough for the beam of light to cross the smoke detector. Click! and then some electronic bleeping. Little servo motors fire lethargically into life, then collapse in exhaustion. The alarm soon runs down to a tiny drone, then silence.

But there's quite a loud report from off to the east somewhere.

Austin seems fascinated by the beam of light.

And find yourself stepping off a cliff. All is well for a moment, and then like a cartoon character you notice there is no ground beneath you and you plummet to a stony death far below.


    *** You have died ***

Or have you?  No... this isn't quite the end. You see an intense blue-white light at the end of what seems a tunnel, and drift toward it until you realise that you are staring, dazed, into the light of the slide projector, and have hardly moved at all.

East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in and the dead end south is bright with sunlight through a square open hatchway in the roof.

In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside.


Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.

A hatchway in the east wall, onto an old iron fire escape, is open and light floods in through it. (Some fool must have set the alarm off.)

A secret door stands open in the south wall!

You clamber out onto a rickety ladder which runs right down the east wall of the Hall, and nervously descend...

Beside the Drive
At the foot of the Hall is the drive, a long gravel lane approaching the house through trees.

Since your family are intermittently loading suitcases into the car, which only makes you feel guilty, the only safe way to creep away is along the public footpath, to northeast.

Wistaria climbs a desperately rickety fire escape up the east side of the Hall, and so might you: at the top the fire escape door into the attic is open.

Public Footpath
By a stile in the public footpath across the fields to the village, which lies to the north. Sitting on the stile you have a splendid view of the house and its battlements. The air is ablaze with pollen and dragonflies.

It might be possible to scramble down to a hollow, but it surely wouldn't be pleasant.


Stone Cross
Beside the long triangle of the green, under the stone cross of the First World War memorial. The public footpath runs south to a stile. The village is tiny: the parish church, the "Goat and Compasses" pub (which, owing to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few houses and desultory tea-shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall.

Old Evans, the village racing enthusiast, sits on the steps of the memorial, combing the back pages of his "Racing Times" newspaper.

>x memorial. look up Gerard in History
The stone cross, for the fallen of the Great War of 1914-18, contains more names than there are houses in the village.

Your eye is caught by Second Lieutenant Gerard Meldrew of the 19th/21st Rifles, and you shiver, although the afternoon is warm.

Roger's eldest son Gerard (1898-1916) was killed in the Battle of the Somme. His mother, "Marie Swelldon", gave up writing afterwards.

>x church
The fourteenth-century Church of St Michael and All Angels doesn't seem to be locked up, exactly - just barred from the other side.

>x pub
In the days of Oliver Cromwell, it was called "God Encompasseth", but the locals have worn down the name over the centuries to "Goat and Compasses". It is of course closed, owing to the licensing laws. You congratulate yourself on living in such a modern, forward-looking country.

It might be possible to scramble down to a hollow, but it surely wouldn't be pleasant.


Hollow
A low, muddy, stinking hollow, trodden with reeds, dried out in the long summer and no more than moist now. You could climb back up, or go northwest, though that would mean crawling through a thorny hedge.

There's a bird's nest at the bottom of the hollow.

Entwined in the nest is a bunch of nuts.

And sat upon it is, as you might expect, a bird: a corn crake, in fact.

Mosaic
This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.

>w. w. se

Lawn Ornaments
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden least visible from the house.

The lawn is lightly coated with broken plaster and dust, and in the spot where the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well.


Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

A big motorised garden roller is parked here.

You can also see a cracked medicine bottle (which is empty) here.


Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

Dark Passage
A passage which slants very slightly down to the south, which is full of coal dust, to which you are unfortunately allergic. Not somewhere to linger.

A secret passage slants down to the east through a sandstone recess.

At the north end is a metal door, standing open.


Sandstone Passage
A flight of sandstone steps, cut in the 1920s when an Egyptological craze was sweeping England, slants down from the coal-dust passage to the east.


The Octagon
A broad, dark octagonal room devoted to dull exhibits of the disastrous Nile Valley Expedition of '21 - the few good ones were donated to the British Museum. A back staircase leads west to the unbuilt extension, while the entrance seems to be the cobwebbed passage southeast. High windows on the northern face let in dim light.

There is a little window-vent high in the southwest wall.

Hedgery
Named by some family wag generations back, this is a restful hedge garden, crowned with a summer house to the north, widening out to a broad croquet lawn east.

A flock of sparrows crowds around the gutters of the summer house. Every now and then one flits up and lands somewhere else, and they bustle about chirpily.

Summer House
An old wooden summer house, reeking of varnish and uncertain beneath your feet. Several segments of the tall glass many-sided pyramidal roof are missing and others are cracked, but this is still somehow a homely and welcoming retreat. The only entrance is also the only exit.

A croquet mallet stands by one wooden wall.

Something golden hangs by a chain from a loose pane in the roof, but it's too high up to reach.

Startled sparrows circle high in the sky, showing no signs of calming down.

A flock of sparrows crowds around the gutters of the summer house. Every now and then one flits up and lands somewhere else, and they bustle about chirpily.

>e

Croquet Lawn
One of the most beautiful hedge-enclosed, tree-muffled lawns in England, and just out of sight of the house, this has been a jewel in the gardens for centuries. Since the twenties it has also been a croquet lawn, of the regulation twenty-four yards square, laid out with a central coloured peg and six peripheral hoops.

>x peg
There are six arched hoops in a croquet set, arranged around a central peg. These ones have been safely anchored in place since the lawn was laid out in, oh, Midsummer 1923 if family lore is to be believed.

>take ball. drop ball
(putting the Grim Reaper into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

Dropped.

>hit ball with mallet
You strike the ball with the mallet, and a pleasing cracking sound.

The ball runs smoothly across the lawn, along to the northwestern hedge and into an irate squirrel. In a sudden rustle he leaps away, knocking aside a rotten branch and uncovering a tiny gap through the hedge.

Behind Summer House
Among dense hedges by the shabby wood-slatted back of the summer house. Dark scratchy branches hem you in, but you could scramble down to the west or out onto the croquet lawn southeast.

One board of the back wall is noticeably loose, making a good-sized crack.

You can also see your irate squirrel friend here.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>x squirrel. x crack
Not at all shy when on his own territory.

Through the crack you can see the summer house.

>pull board
The squirrel rears up and nips you on the wrist. You withdraw, hurt.

>show nuts to squirrel
The squirrel finds them of consuming interest.

>put nuts in crack
You throw the nuts through the loose board into the summer house, and the squirrel jumps up after them, battering through the board and opening up a hole in the wall.

Summer House
An old wooden summer house, reeking of varnish and uncertain beneath your feet. Several segments of the tall glass many-sided pyramidal roof are missing and others are cracked, but this is still somehow a homely and welcoming retreat. The only entrance is also the only exit.

The squirrel sits here, watchfully pecking away at the nuts.

Something golden hangs by a chain from a loose pane in the roof, but it's too high up to reach.

Sparrows chirp happily away to themselves around the high gutter.

>blow whistle
Fweep!  Fweep!

The sparrows swoop down onto the roof, battering against the glass. In the process the gold watch comes loose, and falls to the ground with a disconcerting thud.

It just misses the squirrel, who bolts away, startled.

The sudden motion once more disturbs the flighty sparrows, who take to the skies. You feel rather deserted all of a sudden.

You could easily squeeze past the loose board south into the summer house.


Mosaic
This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is empty) here.

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.


Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.


Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.


East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in and the dead end south is bright with sunlight through a square open hatchway in the roof.

In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside.

>s. e. ne. n

Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.

A hatchway in the east wall, onto an old iron fire escape, is open and light floods in through it. (Some fool must have set the alarm off.)

A secret door stands open in the south wall!

You clamber out onto a rickety ladder which runs right down the east wall of the Hall, and nervously descend...

Beside the Drive
At the foot of the Hall is the drive, a long gravel lane approaching the house through trees.

Since your family are intermittently loading suitcases into the car, which only makes you feel guilty, the only safe way to creep away is along the public footpath, to northeast.

Wistaria climbs a desperately rickety fire escape up the east side of the Hall, and so might you: at the top the fire escape door into the attic is open.


Public Footpath
By a stile in the public footpath across the fields to the village, which lies to the north. Sitting on the stile you have a splendid view of the house and its battlements. The air is ablaze with pollen and dragonflies.

It might be possible to scramble down to a hollow, but it surely wouldn't be pleasant.


Stone Cross
Beside the long triangle of the green, under the stone cross of the First World War memorial. The public footpath runs south to a stile. The village is tiny: the parish church, the "Goat and Compasses" pub (which, owing to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few houses and desultory tea-shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall.

Old Evans, the village racing enthusiast, sits on the steps of the memorial, combing the back pages of his "Racing Times" newspaper.

>take watch. hypnotise Evans
You already have that.

You set the gold watch swinging, back and forth, spinning the light. Old Evans, who is nine-tenths hypnotised most of the time anyway, succumbs easily.

>ask Evans for Moon
He looks at you in a hypnotic daze, and before you can say "How heartless I am" he obediently hands you the Moon.

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south, and hits the glass ball, which diffracts it into a beautiful spectrum across the ceiling.


Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to go is back up to the observatory.

You can see a ship in a bottle here.

The south wall is lit up by the projector.

A beam of white light points directly backward from the projector, through the north doorway into the Observatory.

>put Moon in slot. n
The south wall lights up with the picture on the Crescent Moon, beautifully magnified and amazingly life-like. Why, you'd hardly know there was a wall there at all.

Parish Church
Before this was the Norman church of St Michael and All Angels, it was a Saxon one: this is an ancient site. A great space of stone, filled with dark wooden pews and woven mattings. Flowers left over from Sunday grace the lectern and altar. A narrow stair leads upward, and the village green lies to the south.

Old side chapels lie east and west.

Set into the floor, and slightly raised, is the Moonstone, an ancient broad flagstone the size of a door, inscribed with a crescent moon.

>x moonstone
The Moonstone is very old, probably pre-dating the rest of the church by some centuries. Legends about it abound: some say the spirits of the departed pass beneath. Old iron rings are set in it, but nobody has ever succeeded in lifting the colossal weight.

>[ I don't know who was there before me:
  One person, several, none;
  It doesn't matter.
  There are marks on the slabs of rock,
  Some beautiful, all mysterious;
  Some certainly not made by human hands.
  
  -- Primo Levi, "A Valley"]

Legend has it nothing holds down the stone, but if so it's far too heavy to budge.

The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south, and hits the glass ball, which somehow bends it so that it strikes the mural at the sign of Scorpio.

Austin rolls over on his back and stretches.


Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to go is back up to the observatory.

You can see a ship in a bottle here.

The south wall displays the picture on the miniature, beautifully magnified and amazingly life-like. Why, you'd hardly know there was a wall there at all.

A beam of white light points directly backward from the projector, through the north doorway into the Observatory.

At that exact grid reference is Meldreustrasse, a minor back street which houses a museum of arcana.

Suddenly you remember!  You visited the place once, and the curator Doktor Stein showed you round... and he hypnotised you into a swirl of unconsciousness...


Museum Foyer
The Museum of Arcana is deserted after nightfall and only dimly lit by distant sodium street-lamps. Outside it is a stormy October night and rain beats against the windowpanes. Shadows swoop and dive in the air like bats.

The revolving door to northeast, which leads out, seems to be solidly blocked off. But a dim passage runs south, through a strange metal corridor.

A publicity poster is displayed for passers-by outside to see.

You pass between the steel walls and a light passes over you. Now you know how paper feels in a photocopier - in this case, one which jams. Steel barriers appear across the corridor, and you are obliged to withdraw back to the foyer.

After a moment, the barriers recede again.

There is a sharp hiss as you nimbly jump over the ball, and then a horrid clang as the barriers come together behind you.

Hall of Exhibits
A great square gloomy room, just south of the foyer. There are square lintelled doorways east and west. The storm is dark, and the windows are high, but there's just enough light to see by.

Resting on a little display table is a Tarot box.

>x still life
A disturbing painting, perhaps by Edvard Munch, this is a still life of a seedling on a table, surrounded by a rusty iron rod with a star on the end, a glass bottle, a lamp and a bunch of keys. No doubt these arcane objects held some special significance for primitive tribes now absorbed into civilisation.

It sounds like a thinly, but enthusiastically, attended football match. There are ragged German chants but only the word "Eumenides" pokes out.

Eternally pursuing Greek goddesses, they enforced divine rules by punishing the families of miscreants through all time.

Cabinet Room
An annexe to the museum, containing sundry archaelogical finds, badly labelled in German (which you can hardly read at the best of times) and securely pinioned inside glass cabinets. The storm outside thrashes against the narrow dark windows.

One cabinet looks particularly vulnerable.

The rod charges with etherial power, drawn up from the earth through ley lines...

Finally reacting to the alarm you set off, Doktor Stein appears and steps toward you, clapping his hands sharply. And dozens of robed figures leap out of the darkness - but these are no security guards. Their faces are painted hideously and they betray no emotion as they pinion you tight...

"So, Meldrew. It is all as it was prophesied," says Stein in a perfectly conversational tone as he forces your mouth open and makes you swallow a violet pill.

"One of your apothecary ancestors made this drug!  Appropriate, no?"

You feel queasy, but this is perhaps the least of your problems as they drag you off...


Coven Cell
An old administrative office of the museum, emptied and made into a prison cell: amateur but effective.

As you might expect, the cell door is closed.

>point Returning at me
You are engulfed in a cloud of spinning white lights, like insects. When the swarm clears, you find yourself transported...

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.


Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is empty) here.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south, and hits the glass ball, which diffracts it into a beautiful spectrum across the ceiling.

Austin seems fascinated by the beam of light.


Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house.

East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in and the dead end south is bright with sunlight through a square open hatchway in the roof.

In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside.

>s. e

Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.

A hatchway in the east wall, onto an old iron fire escape, is open and light floods in through it. (Some fool must have set the alarm off.)

A secret door stands open in the south wall!

You clamber out onto a rickety ladder which runs right down the east wall of the Hall, and nervously descend...

Beside the Drive
At the foot of the Hall is the drive, a long gravel lane approaching the house through trees.

Since your family are intermittently loading suitcases into the car, which only makes you feel guilty, the only safe way to creep away is along the public footpath, to northeast.

Wistaria climbs a desperately rickety fire escape up the east side of the Hall, and so might you: at the top the fire escape door into the attic is open.

Public Footpath
By a stile in the public footpath across the fields to the village, which lies to the north. Sitting on the stile you have a splendid view of the house and its battlements. The air is ablaze with pollen and dragonflies.

It might be possible to scramble down to a hollow, but it surely wouldn't be pleasant.


Hollow
A low, muddy, stinking hollow, trodden with reeds, dried out in the long summer and no more than moist now. You could climb back up, or go northwest, though that would mean crawling through a thorny hedge.

There's a bird's nest at the bottom of the hollow.

Mosaic
This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.


Lawn Ornaments
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden least visible from the house.

The lawn is lightly coated with broken plaster and dust, and in the spot where the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well.


Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

A big motorised garden roller is parked here.

You can also see a cracked medicine bottle (which is empty) here.

Up the Plane Tree
A magnificent view of the gardens would be yours, were it not for the branches and leaves which surround you. You can make out Aunt Jemima up at one of the conservatory windows, but hide from her view. Down below, the privet-hedge layout of the maze can be seen through the lower branches.

Consulting Room
The stairs end at a shabby room, with screened windows, lit by incense sticks and sevenbranched candelabra. A doorway with a hanging bead curtain leads west. In the centre of the room is a table, on which is an electric bell push and a wicked Tarot pack.

At last, after all these centuries!  But there is little I can do to ease your way, save to return the staff you left with me for safe keeping."  And she shows you out. You feel rather bewildered.

Suddenly an enormous beanstalk sprouts out of the ground, exactly as per fairy tale, reaching up high into the sky!  You yawn convulsively.

>u. n

Up the Beanstalk
At the top of the beanstalk, in amongst the clouds. There is no safe way to go from here except back down, not surprisingly. A dangerous way might be to step out onto the clouds to the north, but even if this is a fairy-tale it would be taking a lot on trust.


Heavenly Place
Heaven, you always imagined, would be a world of marble pillars, fluffy clouds, harps and angelic ladies with serene expressions. You were right about the last part. An angel is sitting here behind some new office furniture, next to a blue Tourist Information sign. A bridge of cloud extends south across the sky to the beanstalk. There is some choral singing going on somewhere, but not loud enough for you to hear properly. Not in this life, anyway.

"Good day," says the angel with a memorable smile. "As a reward for your act of faith, may I welcome you to our little information service. We try to be as helpful as possible to explorers who are lost, or can't think how to solve their problems. Is there anything, pray, which you would like a hint about, or which you'd like to show me?  You are permitted three hints in all, in accordance with standard practice."

>x angel
If you were to cast a film of your adventures so far, you would hire Dame Judi Dench to play this lady.

Angels with harps float by, gossiping about you in a kindly way.

Vegetable Garden
A recently-turned vegetable garden, using up a shady corner of the garden. The patch testifies more to good intentions than horticulture.

A giant runner-bean plant leads up vertiginously into the sky from here.


Clearing
A clearing at the edge of the garden, surrounded by walls and the privet hedges of the maze. To the east is the plane tree, to the west an opening in the wall makes a garage entrance and to the south is a small vegetable garden.

>e. se. e

Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

You can see a cracked medicine bottle (which is empty) here.


Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.


Beside the Wall
The east-west path along the foot of Meldrew Hall ends here at one of the carved walls bordering the garden.

A shrub is being nursed in a wide round tub in the centre of the path, sheltered behind the wall.

The timber lid stands open beside the shrub, revealing the old barrel-hatch.

Lawn Ornaments
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden least visible from the house.

The lawn is lightly coated with broken plaster and dust, and in the spot where the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well.


Mosaic
This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.

A dismal crypt, disused, rainswept and strewn with leaves. Light streams in from the square hole in the roof. There are no bones or urns on show.

The south wall forms a giant bronze mural, which has stood the test of time.

Jagged Passage
An eerie passage, running down from an opening at the north to murky depths in the south. The walls are jagged, uneven and decorated with bones. An unpleasantly stale, charnel odour drifts in through a gap to the east.

Sarcophagus
Well, perhaps "sarcophagus" is a little melodramatic, but it's that kind of moment. This must be somewhere under the old parish church. You are stooped over inside a stone tomb, stained and crumbled with decay, broken only by a crevice you crawled in by. It is a nightmarish place.

Nightmarishly, even the floor you kneel on is a fallen tombstone.

>look up Henri in History
Very little is known about Henri, who lived at some time in the fifteenth century. As a young man he fought at Agincourt, and seems to have been some kind of combat engineer. The story goes that he acquired his nickname, The Black Post, from a joke made by the King when he was standing up to his waist in a ditch. He must have been proud of it because his coat of arms bears his name written down the left hand side, and Black Post down the right.

In his later years he became morbidly possessed, and (according to legend) spent his declining years working on his own tomb, which he insisted would be of celestial importance.

A large, grisly cave, deep under the garden, dimly lit and eerie. Darkness curls around the natural pillars of rock like a mist: and there is a peculiar, vaguely familiar odour to it. The only obvious routes out are an uneven passage climbing to the north and a crawl west.

Universe Maintenance Room
You really should try to be more awestruck, for this is Merlin's cave, the hub of Creation. Every visitor perceives this place differently, according to his or her own myths and beliefs. Your particular creed being science, there is only a black metal one-metre cube with an unimpressive collection of gauges and dials. An aluminium staircase leads up.

Particularly prominent are a large dial, like the volume control on an expensive hi-fi amplifier, and a big electrician's switch. Both are labelled in small print.

Contraption Room
The cartoonist Heath Robinson used to specialise in drawings of fantastically complicated machines of string, pulleys, levers, counterweights, cogs, mice running about on wheels and the like. Just such a contraption fills the west end of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass wall which, although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.

The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east.

The north edge of the room is a big sheet of dull amber-coloured metal.

Amid the glass wall is an iron panel divided into a three-by-five grid.

Behind the glass is a kind of see-saw of two leather baskets at opposite ends of an oak pivot. In one corner of the roof, above the far end of the see-saw, is a hole through which dim natural light emanates.

Projecting out of the back of the panel mechanism at the near end is a metal hand, which grasps a cannonball in mid-air.

The lower basket contains a glowing golden orb.

>x sheet
Someone rather good-looking (you can't help thinking) is reflected in the metal surface.

The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.


Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps.

The only way to go is back up to the observatory.

Ruined Castle Cafe
This crowded, bohemian cafe bears only a passing resemblance to the ruined castle of the Tarot card: the decor imitates castle walls and arrowslits. You find yourself sitting at a table for one in the centre of the cafe floor. It is noisy, bustling and cheery, and a string quartet plays Strauss under the chattering of German voices. Your chances of attracting a waiter are very slight.

Over in one corner, you can see a little square window, behind which must be the store of cups and glasses. Remembering this, you are distracted and unable to enjoy the entertainment. Even the table is annoying. It must have one leg shorter than the rest, or something, because it rattles now and then.

The table rattles again.

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.


Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.


Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

Sea Shore
A rough rocky sea shore below barely-climbable cliffs, against which inviting deep blue sea laps. It seems to be early morning, soon after dawn, from the look of the sun on the water.

Chained to the cliff face is the beautiful Andromeda, looking nobly out to sea as she awaits her fate.

Avert your eyes. She is naked (unless you count a hairband), as was fashionable for human sacrifices: the victim left overnight without food or shelter until the dawn. It has to be said that she doesn't look all that keen to be rescued.

Cliffs
On top of some exposed cliffs on the Mediterranean. A dangerous slither down leads on one side to the shore, all other ways down being even more hazardous. Atop the cliffs is the Pharos tower, a round stone pinnacle lighthouse, but there is no way in from here.

A grassy walk leads east, and a narrow crack leads southwest into a cave mouth.


Clifftop Walk
A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west to the village not far east. These fields are occupied by herds of hardy mountain goats, continually butting each other and frisking. To the south a path leads across sparse grassland to a great outgrowth of some kind.


Wall of Thorns
The rather sparse rolling landscape is dominated here by a massive, and suspiciously unnatural, wall of thorns, which forms a great ring about an area perhaps a hundred yards in diameter. There are goat pastures to the north.

The wall rustles and clashes its thorns like a beast alive.

Fire leaps out from the rod into the heart of the thorn wall, which screams out as it burns, revealing a great hole through the wild flames.

Temple of Zeus
The beautiful candle-lit Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble pillars which is quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the north. So much for all the rumours about hoards of treasure - it looks as if Zeus (who is, by the way howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along.

A grassy walk leads east, and a narrow crack leads southwest into a cave mouth.


Clifftop Walk
A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west to the village not far east. These fields are occupied by herds of hardy mountain goats, continually butting each other and frisking. To the south a path leads across sparse grassland to a great outgrowth of some kind.

The goats obediently part to allow you to get by.

Outside Taverna
A long walk along the cliffs from the lighthouse leads naturally here, just outside the Eraina Taverna, whose open doorway lies to the south.

The god Apollo moves in mysterious ways, for another fig has appeared on the tree.

Cave Mouth
A dry cave opening from a crack to the northeast, becoming a fair-sized cavern, furnished with bronze and lit by trestle lamps chained from the ceiling.

The Oracle, the masked priestess of Apollo, stands here behind an obsidian altar-stone, three cubits cubed: to her side is a bronze urn, mouthing perpetual flame.

>put fig in urn. ask Oracle about me
You have pleased the god Apollo - Loxias, god of words and counsel, as he was once called!  Very wise.

The priestess, Pythian oracle of Loxias, seems hardly to hear or understand: but goes into a trance, swaying to a sensuous rhythm: and chants, in English,

 "Like the eruptions of Sicilian mounts
  shall come devices to ruin a castle,
  which no bronze armour can withstand
  save, it may be, a veil of the neck."

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.


Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is empty) here.

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south, and hits the glass ball, which somehow bends it so that it strikes the mural at the sign of Virgo.

Austin rolls over on his back and stretches.


Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to go is back up to the observatory.

You can see a tourist map and a ship in a bottle here.

The south wall displays the picture on the Maiden, beautifully magnified and amazingly life-like. Why, you'd hardly know there was a wall there at all.

A beam of white light points directly backward from the projector, through the north doorway into the Observatory.

Lighthouse
You stand atop a pinnacle of stone, on an early Pharos, or lighthouse. Considerately enough, the builders have provided a spiral staircase down. The cliffs below are familiar, but it's a little later in the day than your arrival on the sea shore. There seems to be very little traffic at the moment, though a smudge on the horizon might possibly be a quinquireme.

In the centre of the pinnacle is a marvellous device of polished bronze mirrors, its open end pointed out across the bay. The sun is rising and the sky is clear blue over the Mediterranean: it's going to be a beautiful day.

You hear a sharp click!

The flash suddenly gives an enormous magnesium-flare flash, almost blinding in its intensity. Your eyes take a little while to adjust. Consequently you can only hear as the smudge on the horizon rises from the waves, becomes an enormous Kraken sea monster and lunges for the stone tower. (Considering this is supposed to be a Greek myth it feels surprisingly like a Japanese 1960s creature film.)  The Kraken swipes at you, overreaches itself and falls over forward, impaling itself extremely messily on the pharos. Your eyes just about recover by the time the rest of your body is crushed by its weight.

Up on Mount Olympus, Zeus is still cross. "Take me to your Leda", you wittily demand, but this does not seem to improve matters. Poseidon also looks rather fed up, but luckily a sizeable faction of goddesses takes your side and arranges to have you resurrected...

Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

Lawn Ornaments
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden least visible from the house.

The lawn is lightly coated with broken plaster and dust, and in the spot where the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well.


Mosaic
This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.

>mosaic, lagach

One whole wall is an abstract Cubist mural painting.

The cliffs below are familiar, but it's a little later in the day than your arrival on the sea shore. Much traffic plies across the bay, and trade seems to be picking up again now that the Kraken has gone.

In the centre of the pinnacle is a marvellous device of polished bronze mirrors, its open end pointed out across the bay. The Mediterranean sparkles in the hot afternoon sun.

You can see some old gardeners' gloves, a canvas rucksack (in which are Andromeda's amber hairband, the Pan pipes, an inscribed stone, a gleaming amber gem, a glowing golden orb, a marble rose, a papyrus fragment, a smooth round stone, a discarded matchbook, a Tarot box (which is empty), a miniature, a weed killer bottle, a gold watch on a chain, a croquet mallet, a bird whistle, a model golden sceptre, a charcoal sketch, a gas mask, a green branch, a spade, a silk handkerchief, a poster, a steel wrench, an old striped scarf, an antique jewellery box (which is empty), a chocolate biscuit, an old smudged battery, an electric torch (which is closed), the Rods of Returning, Husbandry, Luck, Fire, Bronze and Stalking, six Tarot cards (the Castle, Crescent Moon, Grim Reaper, Drowned Sailor, Fool and Ace of Cups), a long wrought iron key, a small brass key, a gothic-looking iron key, a delicate gold key, a ragged scroll, a dog-eared old letter, an ancient prayer book, a romantic novel, Hobson's classical dictionary, a postcard of the Champs-Elysees, the History of the Meldrews (vol.

Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

Hedgery
Named by some family wag generations back, this is a restful hedge garden, crowned with a summer house to the north, widening out to a broad croquet lawn east.

A flock of sparrows crowds around the gutters of the summer house. Every now and then one flits up and lands somewhere else, and they bustle about chirpily.


Croquet Lawn
One of the most beautiful hedge-enclosed, tree-muffled lawns in England, and just out of sight of the house, this has been a jewel in the gardens for centuries. Since the twenties it has also been a croquet lawn, of the regulation twenty-four yards square, laid out with a central coloured peg and six peripheral hoops.

Causeway
A warm winter's night in the ancient city of Alexandria, on the Heptastadion causeway across the harbour to the Island of Pharos (to north). The Mediterranean waters lap against the land bridge, and the whole city (southeast) is lit up with torches: it is a night of celebration.


Crossroads
The great crossroads at the heart of chlamys-shaped Alexandria, greatest city of the civilised world. The northwest-southeast road runs from the causeway to the Tower: the main road runs southwest from the Necropolis gate, northeast to the great public buildings of the city.

Yes, 2000 oxen dressed in gold, as many dogs, and the giraffes, the antelopes, the gnus, parrots, elephants, wildebeest... ostriches pulling carts, a white bear...

>ne
The enormous procession, which throngs the great streets of Alexandria, is impossible to push your way through. Better just enjoy the spectacle.

Next the dancers, in a great masque of the life of Alexander the Great, his travels, conquests, founding of the City, and so on. The delicate matter of how exactly his general Ptolemy took over is omitted, since Ptolemy's son Ptolemy II is now very much in charge.

>remove cloak. turn it
You take off the grey cloak.

The centrepiece of the procession: an enormous gold ribboned phallus, two hundred feet long and with a giant star on the end. Inexplicably, you are the only person present who feels this to be in doubtful taste.

You turn the cloak inside out.

A procession of women follows next, each in the national dress of an allied city state, from all over the Hellenistic world, North Africa to Sicily to Asia.

>wear cloak. ne
You put on the cloak of many colours.

The procession ends as it began, with a great Evening Star, before falling into a shambolic crowd of revellers, drunken and maudlin.

The procession happily accommodates another crazily-dressed loon.

The main southwest-northeast road forks off with a road due north to the Theatre. Despite the kaleidoscopic din you are impressed by the sober majesty of the Museum of the Ptolemies, whose fine portico entrance, decked with reliefs, is southeast.

Warehouses and Port

Island of Pharos
The island of the Pharos: the lighthouse after which others are named, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, blazes into the sharp moonlit sky. It is 120 metres high, a circle on an octagon on a square.

A light wind blows across the coastal defences. On this spot, seventy-two scholars first translated the Old Testament into Greek: shivering continuously if it was as chilly as this. A narrow causeway runs south across the harbour.

In one wall of the wave defences is a rusty seaweed-wreathed iron grating, closed up tight.

Harbour Mouth (in the skiff)
As the skiff passes the jaws of the Royal Harbour, beneath the great Pharos light, you have a final view of the receding civilisation of Alexandria: ahead lies the vast, oil-calm Mediterranean and moonlight on the waters.

Time passes.

The sails billow, then slacken...

Drifting (in the skiff)
You drift in the wide, peaceful Lunar sea. Curious fish, their yellow-green eyes gleaming beneath the silver ripples, brush past your wake: the night zephyr is almost slack but still you drift. Minutes pass like hours in paradise.

Time passes.

Light brightens into day. The skiff drifts, drifts upon...

Garden Stream (in the skiff)
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.


Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.


Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south, and hits the glass ball, which somehow bends it so that it strikes the mural at the sign of Leo.

Austin rolls over on his back and stretches.

>x Austin
(Aunt Jemima has two cats, Jane and Austin, but she finds Austin especially annoying - about the only point you have ever agreed with her about.)

Austin, a ginger with a long tail and an uncompromisingly lazy expression, is the kind of cat who hates being pushed around.

Austin purrs and licks one of his paws.

>push Austin south
Austin reluctantly accompanies you.

Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to go is back up to the observatory.

You can see a tourist map and a ship in a bottle here.

The south wall displays the picture on the charcoal sketch, beautifully magnified and amazingly life-like. Why, you'd hardly know there was a wall there at all.

A beam of white light points directly backward from the projector, through the north doorway into the Observatory.

Library Storage
Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.

You can see a book of Twenties poetry here.

Unreal City
This is a city side street, but as if seen through the grey of despair. People stream by, some of whom you almost recognise, as if dead. The street runs east-west, and to the north is a doorway into a grubby tenement building.

Shadowy Hallway
This shambolic flat, extending to the east, shares a filthy hallway with the one upstairs. To the south, passers-by pass by along the street. Peeling-away posters have been stuck up on top of each other on the walls, in such a way that you can only read the most recent.


Bohemia
Flats occupied by starving-but-noble artists can be romantic and stylish despite the squalor. This one, however, is simply a one-room hovel, caked with paint, littered with brushes and improvised easels, and you can't help standing on tiptoe here.

One whole wall is an Impressionist mural painting of nude bathers.

XIIth Dynasty Pyramid
Ransacked, dimly-lit, cramped and empty, this rough-built and uneven burial mound is to the Great Pyramids of Giza (built just a century before) what the summerhouse in your garden is to Windsor Castle. There are only dull painted writings, an unpleasant odour and a passage out to the north.

>n. ne. nw

Necropolis
A spacious, sombre, moonlit and magnificent valley of tombs, some brand new, just outside the walls of Alexandria (to the northeast). Already it is ancient. Most of the little termite-hill style pyramids have been invaded time after time: indeed, one pyramid's entrance gapes open to the south.

You stand near the tombstone, which has become rather more interesting now that a flight of steps downward has appeared.

Birds of prey circle high in the night sky, their talons glinting in the moonlight.

The great crossroads at the heart of chlamys-shaped Alexandria, greatest city of the civilised world. The northwest-southeast road runs from the causeway to the Tower: the main road runs southwest from the Necropolis gate, northeast to the great public buildings of the city.

The expression "You can't take it with you" doesn't seem to be popular hereabouts.

And even that is not the end, for you suddenly crash into buffers at one end. What a lucky escape, you think... for a moment...

Buried Alive
You lie in the mummy case, your arms folded across each other, face grimaced, running out of air rapidly and with almost no room to maneouvre. The coffin lid is about ten times heavier than you, and its seal is very good.

>u

Your spirit rises, prepared as it was for the afterlife, and diffuses through the solid gold of the coffin by sheer effort of will, finally beginning to recoalesce. You stagger, confused, through dark caves until you finally come to light, clutching something solid...

Sarcophagus
Well, perhaps "sarcophagus" is a little melodramatic, but it's that kind of moment. This must be somewhere under the old parish church. You are stooped over inside a stone tomb, stained and crumbled with decay, broken only by a crevice you crawled in by. It is a nightmarish place.

Nightmarishly, even the floor you kneel on is a fallen tombstone.

Charnel Passage
A long, winding, vile passage through the earth, running east to west. The distasteful odour grows stronger as you go east.


Jagged Passage
An eerie passage, running down from an opening at the north to murky depths in the south. The walls are jagged, uneven and decorated with bones. An unpleasantly stale, charnel odour drifts in through a gap to the east.


Crypt
A dismal crypt, disused, rainswept and strewn with leaves. Light streams in from the square hole in the roof. There are no bones or urns on show.

The mural stands slightly to one side, revealing a passage leading downward.

Bohemia
Flats occupied by starving-but-noble artists can be romantic and stylish despite the squalor. This one, however, is simply a one-room hovel, caked with paint, littered with brushes and improvised easels, and you can't help standing on tiptoe here.

One whole wall is an Impressionist mural painting of lilies on a pond.

XIIth Dynasty Pyramid
Ransacked, dimly-lit, cramped and empty, this rough-built and uneven burial mound is to the Great Pyramids of Giza (built just a century before) what the summerhouse in your garden is to Windsor Castle. There are only dull painted writings, an unpleasant odour and a passage out to the north.

There's an old-fashioned elephant's foot umbrella stand beside the garden doorway.

The Octagon
A broad, dark octagonal room devoted to dull exhibits of the disastrous Nile Valley Expedition of '21 - the few good ones were donated to the British Museum. A back staircase leads west to the unbuilt extension, while the entrance seems to be the cobwebbed passage southeast. High windows on the northern face let in dim light.

There is a little window-vent high in the southwest wall.

A rather morbid gilded model coffin rests open here.

You already have that.

Light pulses around the daisy chain, then leaps out to engulf the spindle from the globe which melts into a featureless mahogany rod!

Mosaic
This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.

Necropolis
A spacious, sombre, moonlit and magnificent valley of tombs, some brand new, just outside the walls of Alexandria (to the northeast). Already it is ancient. Most of the little termite-hill style pyramids have been invaded time after time: indeed, one pyramid's entrance gapes open to the south.

You stand near the tombstone, which has become rather more interesting now that a flight of steps downward has appeared.

Birds of prey circle high in the night sky, their talons glinting in the moonlight.


Crossroads
The great crossroads at the heart of chlamys-shaped Alexandria, greatest city of the civilised world. The northwest-southeast road runs from the causeway to the Tower: the main road runs southwest from the Necropolis gate, northeast to the great public buildings of the city.

Next the dancers, in a great masque of the life of Alexander the Great, his travels, conquests, founding of the City, and so on. The delicate matter of how exactly his general Ptolemy took over is omitted, since Ptolemy's son Ptolemy II is now very much in charge.

The procession happily accommodates another crazily-dressed loon.

Outside the Royal Museum
The main southwest-northeast road forks off with a road due north to the Theatre. Despite the kaleidoscopic din you are impressed by the sober majesty of the Museum of the Ptolemies, whose fine portico entrance, decked with reliefs, is southeast.

Tragically, the Theatre is closed tonight, but roads lead past the great stepped bowl: north toward the Palace, south to the Museum and west to the harbour-front.


Outside the Royal Palace of Alexander
A hugely impressive edifice, and everything you might expect from the man who conquered the whole of Asia Minor at an age when most people are starting to think about getting a mortgage.

There are of course guards, but they're trying to catch the procession, so if you're careful not to draw attention to yourself you could probably sneak in to the north.

You take off the cloak of many colours.


You tiptoe into the palace, and immediately dart away from view of the many clerks and civil servants manning the machinery of government even at this late hour. Within seconds, you realise you are...

Lost inside the Palace
Scholars are divided on the origin of the "maze" legend: some hold that to a primitive culture, the Knossos palace was so complex as to seem a maze, and the king so fearsome as to seem a Minotaur.

Others say the early palaces really were labyrinths to protect sacred altars.

And you think it's because this is a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

The magnificent balcony overlooking the Royal harbour of Alexandria. In two hundred years' time, Julius Caesar will be besieged here, and will hold the palace with a tiny force of men against an entire army: and will lose his heart to Cleopatra...

For the mean time, this is a broad stone balustraded balcony. The coin-bright moon, low in the sky, reflects off the black waters far below.

Through the golden eyepiece you see, not the moon (for the astrolabe is tilted too low), but a curious, sunlit, grey triangle.

Fascinated, you strain closer to the vision... closer...

Out on the Spire
There is a beautiful view over the green parceled farmlands and hills surrounding the village, and you feel a certain pride to see Meldrew Hall sitting amongst it. It's also windy and dangerous up here on the grey lead spire of the parish church, beside the old clock: fortunately an opening leads down into the clerestory.

Mounted loosely on the end of the weathervane, an adamantine hand points the way the wind blows.

>x clock
The clock stands at ten past three, as it has done for some years. According to a small commemorative plaque, it was the work of William Snelson the Clockmaker (1776-1848).

The bell-ringing chamber, half-way up the church tower. Thick braided ropes hang down, tailing into sashes. A plaque on one wall announces that in 1901, ten men (Roger Meldrew among them) rang a Kent Triple Bob.


Parish Church
Before this was the Norman church of St Michael and All Angels, it was a Saxon one: this is an ancient site. A great space of stone, filled with dark wooden pews and woven mattings. Flowers left over from Sunday grace the lectern and altar. A narrow stair leads upward, and the village green lies to the south.

Old side chapels lie east and west.

Set into the floor, and slightly raised, is the Moonstone, an ancient broad flagstone the size of a door, inscribed with a crescent moon.


West Side Chapel
An alcove in the ancient west side of the church, beneath stained glass windows of the Resurrection.

A headless adamantine statue lies prone here, a knight on a tomb.

The heart sits well in the so-empty ribcage of the adamantine knight.

The knight comes a little closer, cupping one ear to pantomime listening. He does seem to have partial hearing.

The knight bows, and pulls the enormously heavy Moonstone open. He plainly expected it to be effortless, but by the time he's finished you can almost see ghostly perspiration bead on the ghostly sinews around his adamantine body.

To your horror your body partly thins to mist as you climb down through the threshold!  Alarmed, you pull back. The underworld beneath the Moonstone, it seems, is not for mortals.

The knight strides down into the underworld beneath the Moonstone, to be lost to your sight... forever?

For even he has not life force enough to hold together in the mists: his skeleton begins to clatter away to nothing, falling in all directions, his heart, hand and skull returning Somehow to your feet. And they are altering, altering even as you look down into the void...

Stone Cross
Beside the long triangle of the green, under the stone cross of the First World War memorial. The public footpath runs south to a stile. The village is tiny: the parish church, the "Goat and Compasses" pub (which, owing to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few houses and desultory tea-shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall.

You half-stand, half-float in a golden, misty sphere perhaps ten yards across, which slowly spins. The centre, out of reach and somehow insubstantial, is an eight-by-eight lattice of oblong crystals, bathed in warm pearly light.

Images lurk about the array of oblong crystals.

Public Footpath
By a stile in the public footpath across the fields to the village, which lies to the north. Sitting on the stile you have a splendid view of the house and its battlements. The air is ablaze with pollen and dragonflies.

It might be possible to scramble down to a hollow, but it surely wouldn't be pleasant.


Beside the Drive
At the foot of the Hall is the drive, a long gravel lane approaching the house through trees.

Since your family are intermittently loading suitcases into the car, which only makes you feel guilty, the only safe way to creep away is along the public footpath, to northeast.

Wistaria climbs a desperately rickety fire escape up the east side of the Hall, and so might you: at the top the fire escape door into the attic is open.

With your heart in your mouth, you scale the old fire escape once again, breathing a sigh of relief as you haul yourself in through the open hatchway at the top.

Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.

A hatchway in the east wall, onto an old iron fire escape, is open and light floods in through it. (Some fool must have set the alarm off.)

East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in and the dead end south is bright with sunlight through a square open hatchway in the roof.

In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside.


Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.


Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south, and hits the glass ball, which somehow bends it so that it strikes the mural at the sign of Leo.

Library Storage
Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.

At the foot of the Hall is the drive, a long gravel lane approaching the house through trees.

Since your family are intermittently loading suitcases into the car, which only makes you feel guilty, the only safe way to creep away is along the public footpath, to northeast.

Wistaria climbs a desperately rickety fire escape up the east side of the Hall, and so might you: at the top the fire escape door into the attic is open.


Public Footpath
By a stile in the public footpath across the fields to the village, which lies to the north. Sitting on the stile you have a splendid view of the house and its battlements. The air is ablaze with pollen and dragonflies.

It might be possible to scramble down to a hollow, but it surely wouldn't be pleasant.

>d. nw. w

Hollow
A low, muddy, stinking hollow, trodden with reeds, dried out in the long summer and no more than moist now. You could climb back up, or go northwest, though that would mean crawling through a thorny hedge.

There's a bird's nest at the bottom of the hollow.


Mosaic
This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.


Lawn Ornaments
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden least visible from the house.

The lawn is lightly coated with broken plaster and dust, and in the spot where the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well.

>w. se. e

Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

You can see a cracked medicine bottle (which is empty) here.


Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

A skiff (a small sail-boat) is moored up here.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.


Beside the Wall
The east-west path along the foot of Meldrew Hall ends here at one of the carved walls bordering the garden.

A blooming shrub, gay with red flowers, is being nursed in a wide round tub under the wall here.

The timber lid stands open beside the shrub, revealing the old barrel-hatch.

>d. w. w

Wine Cellars
The wine cellars are now quite badly stocked, many of the hexagonal racks being home only to woodlice now. Much of what there is was laid in by your father and has corked. The barrel-shaft slants upwards to the north, and bright light floods in from the gardens above.


Cellars
Cobwebbed old cellars. There is nothing to see except an opening in one wall onto a dark shaft, and a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel beside it with a handle on. The cellar continues east-to-west and south.

There is a little closed window-vent low in the north wall.


Cellar West
The west end of a disused and shadowy old cellar. It was bricked up when you were a child - you never did find out why. Perhaps the golden, jewelled staircase leading down into smoky mists to the south might be something to do with it.

In the northwest wall is a heavy, imposing ironbound door.

Infinity Symbol
An eerie, dark cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and strewn with great spiders' webs hung from the ragged stone, inhabited only by dead white insects. A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the warmth of the house.

The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.

You shiver with foreboding, but inexplicably feel that the map you're looking for must be somewhere near here.

Around the edge of the disc is a circular arc, surrounding the lemniscus, which passes through nine equally spaced sockets or cylindrical wells.

Murky Cave
This is a murky hillside cave, whose mouth opens to the northeast, though a tight squeeze might lead a little way west. Outside is a clear starry night. There is no traffic noise, and the air smells fresh.

Hanging up on an iron bracket is a flaming torch.

>x pamphlet
It is a summary of the writings of a polemical monk called Gildas, and relates to events following the fall of the tyrant Vortigern at the turn of the fifth century A.D. After dark decades of pillage by Saxon mercenaries, Britain was reunited by Ambrosius Aurelianus and then defended at the Battle of Badon Hill, some time in the early years of the sixth century.

This remarkable victory was of no religious significance, so Gildas does not dwell upon it. He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then chiefly to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an Anglo-Saxon historian.)  Nobody even knows where Badon Hill is any more, or anything else about it, although some students of Welsh poetry believe Ambrosius was the source of the legend of King Arthur.

Spur of Rock
An uncomfortable spur of rock on the hillside crags. The only natural access to this spot is a crevice in the hill to the east, but there is also a securely fastened rope hanging down into the darkness.


Hanging on Rope
You are hanging perilously on a hemp rope, suspended from an overhang of rock above, which drops down into the darkness of the valley. On the tracks below, patrols of men can be heard, and you feel instinctively that they are not friendly.

A single yellow daisy grows from a little tuft of grass on the crags.

This is a murky hillside cave, whose mouth opens to the northeast, though a tight squeeze might lead a little way west. Outside is a clear starry night. There is no traffic noise, and the air smells fresh.


Valley Prospect
The geography is strangely familiar here. You are on a natural shelf on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all-but invisible cleft in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the east.

It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation.


Roman Villa
You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a none-too-secure timber door.


Stream
A stream runs past the villa and cascades down the hillside here, to join the river far below, near the Roman road which will, in 1500 years time, become the motorway which so spoils the view from your back garden. A rough ladder of wood lashed together with leather rests against the villa at the lowest point of the tiled roof.

>u
You climb the ladder and are about to jump onto the roof when you catch sight of a man swaddled in animal furs, spreadeagled over the tiles, looking down into the central courtyard of the villa. He has a nasty-looking sword and since he hasn't seen you, you quietly shin back down the ladder again.

Atrium Cloister
The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a fieldmouse, and hear the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters in from the central courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back north.

Resting against one pillar is a horn made from a tusk, mounted on a long spear-like pole.

There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight.

Guard Quarters
Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently home to military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough blankets which are little more than animal hides. Fortunately for you the guards are absent.

A well-flagstoned forecourt at the villa entrance, surrounded by lesser wooden buildings. Some of these are in use as stables, and figures of men slip between them.

For a deserted villa, this is certainly well-guarded.

>z. z. z
Time passes.

A voice, which can just be heard through the vent, says "Welcome, great masters. We are convened in secret conclave to decide the fate of Britain. Lament, for the old ways are passing!  There will be a dark age, a collapse into many monarchies, and any man who can hold a town will call himself King and heir to Vortigern."

Time passes.

A younger, more impatient voice, says "This is an opportunity!  We must be the power behind the thrones, we will in secret unite and be the true force of the land..."

Time passes.

There is cynical laughter for a moment, and a third voice interjects "And who will lead this, this unity?  We take all sides and none, you know that. There are potent druids in the tents of each general down there in the rabble. They'd kill each other in a second come the battle."

>z. z. z
Time passes.

The first voice speaks once more. "Far worse is to come. The jumped-up kings and their new men will no longer believe in the ancient powers. Already I can feel the druidic magic weakening away, and we are perilously close to the nexus now. In the valleys below, armies wait to fight the decisive battle. Whichever side wins, they will no longer need us. In a matter of hours, the power will be broken forever."

Time passes.

After a sombre silence, a much older voice says "You did right to call us together. There is a path prepared for us, but the sacrifice will be terrible. We must concentrate all the remaining druidical energy into this sacred hill, that it may last through all time, and we must ensure that druids live on this site forever and keep the faith."

Time passes.

The younger voice speaks again. "For now, yes, for a century or two, yes, but what then?  They will forget the old ways, they will no longer truly be druids."

>z
Time passes.

The older voice replies triumphantly. "This is what must be done. They will forget, so we must give them a substitute. We shall accurse them to always seek after this magical stone, which it will be all but impossible for them to find. It will take the form of whatever they most desire. In six hundred years, by my prophecy, religious wars in the East will capture men's hearts, and then they will think it is the Holy Grail, the cup which held the blood of Christ. A thousand years later they will think it is -"  But at this moment the voices move away.

The hinged wooden cover is raised, revealing a circular well about a yard in diameter. It is very dark inside.

An industrious-looking slave (who cooks for the horsemen) is rather surprised to see you, but with creditable presence of mind he summons the guard at once.

Suddenly you are thrust before a druidical figure. He seems to recognise you, and is troubled. Perhaps because of this, your life is saved and you are taken away into custody, down in the valley among the army encampments.

Rough Tent
Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent of stitched animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a central pole. You have no idea where the entrance is, because you were blindfolded on the way in. There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires outside the tent.

You see nothing special about the tent pole.

That's fixed in place.

Without warning a Saxon spy (or, as the guards would no doubt put it, another Saxon spy) is thrown bodily into the tent, careering into the central pole and slumping unconscious on the ground as a result. For a moment the whole tent rocks with the force - the pole was nearly broken.

>x spy. take pole
He is dishevelled, wiry and unconscious. He is also covered with dust and leaves, as if he has been lying down on his front outdoors for hours.

As you uproot the tent-pole, the whole tent collapses ignominiously, the animal hides falling about your head. The hides are heavy and weigh you down, but you just manage to crawl out...

Encampment
Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched at all, because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried out over beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim.

Down at the end of the street, the brown urban waters carry by unpleasant rubbish, and rats scuttle up and over the mounds washed up around you.

On board the Phlebas
A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore to the east. At the helm is a very strange man, at times almost a straw dummy, almost perhaps a hollow cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and casts his eyes to windward.

The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor.

Halfway up, or else halfway down, and a dreary place it is too: nothing but a dark corridor leading north.

The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here.

You heave yourself up to the attic again...

Storage Room (in the dumbwaiter)
A disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on.

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.


Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is empty) here.


Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

>s. se. e

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.


Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.


East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in and the dead end south is bright with sunlight through a square open hatchway in the roof.

In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside.

>s. s

Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.

A hatchway in the east wall, onto an old iron fire escape, is open and light floods in through it. (Some fool must have set the alarm off.)

A secret door stands open in the south wall!


Alison's Writing Room
A pleasantly furnished, if now mildewed, box room. There are engravings of Alison's heroines: Christina Rossetti, Elizabeth Browning, Emily Dickinson and Queen Victoria, an unlikely quartet. The wallpaper is done out in a dice motif, and a square outline of sixes surrounds a rather small door leading back north into the attics.

The flag is spread out as a blanket on the comfortable bed.

On the comfortable bed is a flag of the British Merchant Navy.

Black-latticed windows open on a beautiful summer's day.

There is a long vanity mirror beside the bed.

>take model animal. x mirror
(putting the long wrought iron key into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

In the mirror is one of the most strikingly attractive people you have ever seen in all your born days, carrying a model of a mischievous-looking monkey, which wriggles as it comes alive, a book of Twenties poetry, a tourist map of Paris, some old gardeners' gloves, a daisy chain, a canvas rucksack, a pair of leather sandals and a yellow daisy.

Now that you have finally been able to look it in the eyes, the monkey leaps from your arms, revelling in its new life, and scampers away through the windows onto the balcony, then up and over the side of the house. You can just make it out as it races down the footpath.

A hatchway in the east wall, onto an old iron fire escape, is open and light floods in through it. (Some fool must have set the alarm off.)

A secret door stands open in the south wall!

You clamber out onto a rickety ladder which runs right down the east wall of the Hall, and nervously descend...

Beside the Drive
At the foot of the Hall is the drive, a long gravel lane approaching the house through trees.

Since your family are intermittently loading suitcases into the car, which only makes you feel guilty, the only safe way to creep away is along the public footpath, to northeast.

Wistaria climbs a desperately rickety fire escape up the east side of the Hall, and so might you: at the top the fire escape door into the attic is open.


Public Footpath
By a stile in the public footpath across the fields to the village, which lies to the north. Sitting on the stile you have a splendid view of the house and its battlements. The air is ablaze with pollen and dragonflies.

It might be possible to scramble down to a hollow, but it surely wouldn't be pleasant.


Stone Cross
Beside the long triangle of the green, under the stone cross of the First World War memorial. The public footpath runs south to a stile. The village is tiny: the parish church, the "Goat and Compasses" pub (which, owing to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few houses and desultory tea-shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall.

The monkey sits on Evans' shoulder, cheeping with excitement. Evans has found a pet, and is so gruffly delighted that he has forgotten all about the mascot you stole. Now if he could only predict the 3.40 at Borchester Mills...

Old Evans, the village racing enthusiast, sits on the steps of the memorial, combing the back pages of his "Racing Times" newspaper.

With your heart in your mouth, you scale the old fire escape once again, breathing a sigh of relief as you haul yourself in through the open hatchway at the top.

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is empty) here.


Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

The wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, "Mild-n-Breezy FM", about which the least said the better.

The radio plays a light orchestra arrangement of Kylie Minogue's "I Should Be So Lucky".


Potting Room
This light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.

Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.

Execrable music drifts in from the conservatory.

Jemima hums along to a light orchestra travesty of that hoary old favourite, "Oh Come All Ye Faithful".

>give chocolate to jemima
(first taking the chocolate biscuit)
Jemima grudgingly takes the biscuit and nibbles at it, but she is still sulking.

A shame to see such a good try unrewarded... oh, go on, have an extra five points.

Jemima hums along to a snare drum and strings rendition of Chas and Dave's "Rabbit Song".

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]
