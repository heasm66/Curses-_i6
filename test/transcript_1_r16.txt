[ Nine times she waved the fluttering wimple round,
  And made a little plot of magic ground.
  And in that daisied circle, as men say,
  Is Merlin prisoner till the judgement day...

It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That tourist map of Paris must be up here somewhere in all this clutter, even if it has been five years since your last trip. And it's your own fault. It looks as if your great-grandfather was the last person to tidy up these lofts...

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

>n

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red battery and a tourist map) here.

As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?

>w

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

>s

Airing Cupboard
A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.

Potting Room
This light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous garden implements.

A pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.

Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.

>se

Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

>e

East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.

In the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.

>x rolls

Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.

Storage Room
A disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on.

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.

A steel wrench gathers dust in the corner.

Cellars South
The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is a hole about ten or eleven inches across in the west wall. You peer at this with interest but nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you.

Servant's Room
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

There's a little book on the tiny bedside table.

An old striped scarf hangs up behind the doorway.

>lie down
You get onto the camp bed.

>sleep
You sleep unexpectedly deeply, but just as you think you are starting to wake up, you experience a sudden...

Premonition
It is a frosty, clear night, but there is a scent of camp-fires burning in the distance. You are passing through the landscape as if a ghost, and all seems faintly unreal. To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen.

>e
You pass uncomfortably straight through the hide wall.

The General's Tent
This is the tent of a thin, reedy man who wears no uniform but has an obvious and commanding presence. He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their distance from a trestle table at the north end of the tent.

>n

Shrine of the Bear
This is a kind of improvised shrine. A trestle table bears entrails, crude drawings sketched out on hide, and caged animals: draped beside it is a primitive tapestry of a bear reared up on its hind legs.

On the table is a heavy iron mascot of some kind.

Beside the table is a more substantial adviser, as if she too walks in this strange spirit plane. She is wearing frightening druidical robes, of strange pelts and furs, with nasty-looking charms around her neck. Every so often, she seems to catch sight of you out of the corner of her eye, but then look round and see nothing. The military men do not believe in her power, and yet... they treat her with respect.

>get mascot
The Druid catches sight of your ghostly hand taking the mascot, and immediately begins her occultations, cursing you and your ill-gotten gains. But she is unable to make contact with you, and turns furiously to the tapestry, hissing "lagach" to the Bear. At once a sudden swirl of wind seems to pull her into the rough cloth, dissolving her to nothing.

Camp Fire
You can almost smell fear here. A motley platoon of soldiers are sitting about the embers of a fire. None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it.

>e

Near Dolmen
A standing stone, perhaps a glacial erratic, stands here and on top of it is a shining blue stone, whose brightness almost blinds you. You feel irresistably drawn to it, and your hand reaches out...

(the sepia photograph)
The photograph is one of the very early ones which looks as if it was taken in the dark because the chemicals have gradually oxidised. The poor man in the frame (Mr Roger Meldrew, Esquire) looks as if he was propped up by a big clamp to hold him still for five minutes, and that's because he was.

>read about roger in history book
Roger (1846-1913), the elder of a pair of twins, was very Victorian indeed, especially in his disapproval of his beautiful young wife's literary career. He thought her romances so immoral that he refused to allow the family name to appear on them. A prominent local vestryman, his own writing was confined to a great many monographs on the problems of municipal drainage, but he died before his grand National Sewerage Plan was complete.

Roof
This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below. There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south.

Battlements
The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.

It is peculiarly cold here.

>get key
(the gothic-looking iron key)
As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, into a ghostly head which opens its mouth and eats up the key!  The rest of the ghostly body solidifies about the head and rises to swagger before you.

The ghost laughs in a gurgling kind of way, as it were always coughing and spluttering.

>give wishbone to ghost
(first taking the chicken wishbone)
(putting the guaranteed-unbreakable medicine bottle with a child-proof lock into the canvas rucksack to make room)
The ghost swallows the wishbone, grinning nastily. Then a look of consternation spreads across his face. He begins to choke and as he fades away, his arms flailing wildly, he lets go of the key, which sails through the air onto the roof and (against all odds) falls neatly down a chimney.

Good heavens, so the house has a priest hole after all!  It was always a family legend but nobody seemed to know quite where it was. Apart from a cross painted on one wall and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this spartan cranny is featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the supernatural about... A narrow crawl leads up into the chimney.

This chimney must have been the one the gothic-looking iron key fell down, for here it is.

Low down on one wall is a little hatch door, which if it were open would be large enough to enter.

The dust and grime on the floor almost obscures an ancient prayer book.

You can also see a sooty old stick, an electric torch (closed and providing light) and a small brass key here.

The stairs end at a shabby room, with screened windows, lit by incense sticks and sevenbranched candelabra. A doorway with a hanging bead curtain leads west. In the centre of the room is a table, on which is an electric bell push and a wicked Tarot pack.

>push bell
Madame Sosostris, the famous clairvoyante, breezes in through the hanging curtain and sits behind the table, making waving gestures with her hands.

"First, this I must know, were you born in an even, or an odd, year?"

Madame Sosostris picks up the cards and deals them onto the table. She frowns in concentration as the Grim Reaper, the Fool and then the Drowned Sailor show. She blanches with alarm, then recovers and jabbers something about not taking the cards too literally, the images being symbolic and so on. As rapidly as she possibly can, she warns you to fear death by water and then hustles you out onto the street.

On board the Phlebas
A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore to the east. At the helm is a very strange man, at times almost a straw dummy, almost perhaps a hollow cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and casts his eyes to windward.

The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a real place, like anywhere was real... We are the hollow men, I says, he didn't like that... Hurry up, please, it's time."

You lose all sense of time and place as the boat drifts down river... It comes as a considerable relief to your befuddled nerves when the man helps you off the boat again, and you find yourself:

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

A signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

A little light comes in from an opaque skylight which is at street level outdoors. There is no way out of here, since the only door is shut tight.

An unlabelled whisky bottle, laid on its side and mounted on a wood plaque, lies deservedly unwanted on one of the crates.

The men begin to talk like conspirators, but half in chants. You catch occasional sounds, but can make little sense of them.

As you pull the anchor chain, the masts fold inwards and the decks concertina back, until you're holding no more than a tight bundle of sticks.

Alarmingly, you catch the odd word "incendiary" and are almost sure you can make out someone say "accursed Meldrew" (in the old-fashioned way, you know, so that "accursed" rhymes with "dead"). Paranoia, bound to be. There surely can't really be a conspiracy of druid-worshippers out to get you?

The bundle of sticks will just fit through the bottle's neck. With a sudden spring, just as the last of the stick passes the neck, its masts fold out... and you have put the ship into the bottle.

Thank heavens for the deck rail, something to hang on to while this moment of queasiness passes.

Up the Mast
Coming up here must be one of your less inspired ideas. The mist is all around you, confusing your senses. Two pale, bluish moons hang in a pink sky.

A flagpole juts out portwards from the top of the mast, far too insubstantial to bear any weight. From it hangs the ensign of the British Merchant Navy (which you could just reach the bottom of).

...And the approaching soft, spongy, pinkish sand-bank, which welcomes you with its warmth: you step ashore, and immediately sink into the clammy, living sand, until you are engulfed altogether... and pass out.

However, the hard attic floorboards beneath your back soon wake you again.

Disused Observatory

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south, and hits the glass ball, which somehow bends it so that it strikes the mural at the sign of Capricorn.

Your footfall causes the crystal ball to wobble fractionally, just enough for the beam of light to cross the smoke detector. Click! and then some electronic bleeping. Little servo motors fire lethargically into life, then collapse in exhaustion. The alarm soon runs down to a tiny drone, then silence.

But there's quite a loud report from off to the east somewhere.

You clamber out onto a rickety ladder which runs right down the east wall of the Hall, and nervously descend...

Beside the Drive
At the foot of the Hall is the drive, a long gravel lane approaching the house through trees.

Since your family are intermittently loading suitcases into the car, which only makes you feel guilty, the only safe way to creep away is along the public footpath, to northeast.

Wistaria climbs a desperately rickety fire escape up the east side of the Hall, and so might you: at the top the fire escape door into the attic is open.

Public Footpath
By a stile in the public footpath across the fields to the village, which lies to the north. Sitting on the stile you have a splendid view of the house and its battlements. The air is ablaze with pollen and dragonflies.

It might be possible to scramble down to a hollow, but it surely wouldn't be pleasant.

Stone Cross
Beside the long triangle of the green, under the stone cross of the First World War memorial. The public footpath runs south to a stile. The village is tiny: the parish church, the "Goat and Compasses" pub (which, owing to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few houses and desultory tea-shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall.

Old Evans, the village racing enthusiast, sits on the steps of the memorial, combing the back pages of his "Racing Times" newspaper.

>x cross
The stone cross, for the fallen of the Great War of 1914-18, contains more names than there are houses in the village.

Your eye is caught by Second Lieutenant Gerard Meldrew of the 19th/21st Rifles, and you shiver, although the afternoon is warm.

>read about alison in history book
Under the pseudonym Marie Swelldon, your ancestress Alison (1871-1930) wrote several mildly successful romances. She obsessively collected lucky charms, and advertised in newspapers for double-headed coins and the like (although she never traced a rumoured find of a five-leafed clover, somewhere in County Donegal).

In order to write in tranquillity and to avoid her husband, it was she who installed the fake wall at the far south end of the attic east wing, and each afternoon she would sneak upstairs to push it aside.

Octagonal Tomb
Flaming torches bracketed in the wall gutter as the last oxygen in the air is consumed, and the flicker of flame plays across the yellow-orange glaze of the tomb walls.

This octagonal chamber is lined with Egyptian hieroglyphics. Sand spills across the floor from under the sole entrance, sealed by an ingenious stone slab.

A kind of ship's wheel (of eight-spoked timber) is affixed to the northwest wall.

You try turning the wheel, but it moves only infinitesimally slowly. The door begins to raise the tiniest fraction, and a few grains of sand cascade in slow motion, rattling horribly against each other...

At that exact grid reference is Meldreustrasse, a minor back street which houses a museum of arcana.

Suddenly you remember!  You visited the place once, and the curator Doktor Stein showed you round... and he hypnotised you into a swirl of unconsciousness...


Museum Foyer
The Museum of Arcana is deserted after nightfall and only dimly lit by distant sodium street-lamps. Outside it is a stormy October night and rain beats against the windowpanes. Shadows swoop and dive in the air like bats.

The revolving door to northeast, which leads out, seems to be solidly blocked off. But a dim passage runs south, through a strange metal corridor.

Finally reacting to the alarm you set off, Doktor Stein appears and steps toward you, clapping his hands sharply. And dozens of robed figures leap out of the darkness - but these are no security guards. Their faces are painted hideously and they betray no emotion as they pinion you tight...

"So, Meldrew. It is all as it was prophesied," says Stein in a perfectly conversational tone as he forces your mouth open and makes you swallow a violet pill.

"One of your apothecary ancestors made this drug!  Appropriate, no?"

You feel queasy, but this is perhaps the least of your problems as they drag you off...

This is a rampart on the hillside, a natural ledge leading east. Down below in the valley, rough cottages surround a church. Labourers toil in the fields, and a hay wain is being pulled across the river.

Towering over you is a monstrously awful piece of architecture, a Folly. The freestanding tower has no appreciable purpose and no apparent entrance. The latter is just as well since it looks extremely unsafe.

Madame Sosostris picks up the cards and deals them onto the table. She frowns in concentration as the Star, the Maiden and then the Eight of Wands show. "You have come!  At last, after all these centuries!  But there is little I can do to ease your way, save to return the staff you left with me for safe keeping."  And she shows you out. You feel rather bewildered.

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

Contraption Room
The cartoonist Heath Robinson used to specialise in drawings of fantastically complicated machines of string, pulleys, levers, counterweights, cogs, mice running about on wheels and the like. Just such a contraption fills the west end of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass wall which, although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.

The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east.

The north edge of the room is a big sheet of dull amber-coloured metal.

Amid the glass wall is an iron panel divided into a three-by-five grid.

Behind the glass is a kind of see-saw of two leather baskets at opposite ends of an oak pivot. In one corner of the roof, above the far end of the see-saw, is a hole through which dim natural light emanates.

Projecting out of the back of the panel mechanism at the near end is a metal hand, which grasps a cannonball in mid-air.

The lower basket contains a glowing golden orb.

>x panel

A grassy walk leads east, and a narrow crack leads southwest into a cave mouth.

>e

Clifftop Walk
A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west to the village not far east. These fields are occupied by herds of hardy mountain goats, continually butting each other and frisking. To the south a path leads across sparse grassland to a great outgrowth of some kind.

>s

Wall of Thorns
The rather sparse rolling landscape is dominated here by a massive, and suspiciously unnatural, wall of thorns, which forms a great ring about an area perhaps a hundred yards in diameter. There are goat pastures to the north.

The wall rustles and clashes its thorns like a beast alive.

The rod charges with etherial power, drawn up from the earth through ley lines...

>point it at thorns
Fire leaps out from the rod into the heart of the thorn wall, which screams out as it burns, revealing a great hole through the wild flames. You catch a tantalising glimpse of a great Temple, before the wall heals back. But it is unable to recover entirely, and a charred gap is left to the south. You could probably squeeze through it.

Sacred Earth
Here inside the thorn wall, a north-south path leads across sacred earth into the imposing marble Temple of Zeus. You feel distinctly uneasy walking on such hallowed turf. There are any number of myths about gods getting cross about that sort of thing.

>[ Zeus, whose will has marked for man
  A single way where wisdom lies
  Ordained one eternal plan:
  Man must suffer to be wise.
  
  -- Aeschylus, "Agamemnon"]

s
Zeus, chief of all the gods, appears and hurls a thunderbolt down just before you begin to cross into the Temple. Astonishingly, you beat the luck of the gods and slip into the temple just clear of the thunderbolt. "Damn, missed!" says a sepulchral voice from without.

Temple of Zeus
The beautiful candle-lit Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble pillars which is quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the north. So much for all the rumours about hoards of treasure - it looks as if Zeus (who is, by the way howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along.

Cloisters lead southeast and southwest, deeper into the temple.

Inner Sanctum
Here from the dark heart of the temple, cloisters fork northeast and northwest while a flight of narrowing steps lead down and to the north.

The blind poet Homer half-slumbers here, clutching his syrinx (or Pan-pipes) to himself.

>wake homer
Homer wakes up, with a start. "I suppose you want the syrinx," he grumbles, "they always do. There are three questions you must answer wisely. The usual deal."

(He seems to be under an enchantment and able to speak modern English, or at least American.)

"First: who is the brother of Menelaus?"

Seized by divine inspiration, you launch into J. S. Bach's Passacaglia. Suddenly the great god Apollo appears before you!  As he speaks the very rock reverberates.

   "All wisdom is mine, mortal!
   Though you shall seek out your curse
   A thousand years and more. Now ask!"

Apollo, as he vanishes, laughs in that style more recently popularised by Third World dictators and mad scientists. His priestess, the Oracle, steps out of the shadows.

 "As Hephaestus, master of the metals
  uncovered the gilden sunrise of Helicon
  so, in nine paces and five paces
  when six arches have stood sixty years
  shall even a shade's remains be cast."

Ruined Castle Cafe
This crowded, bohemian cafe bears only a passing resemblance to the ruined castle of the Tarot card: the decor imitates castle walls and arrowslits. You find yourself sitting at a table for one in the centre of the cafe floor. It is noisy, bustling and cheery, and a string quartet plays Strauss under the chattering of German voices. Your chances of attracting a waiter are very slight.

Over in one corner, you can see a little square window, behind which must be the store of cups and glasses. Remembering this, you are distracted and unable to enjoy the entertainment. Even the table is annoying. It must have one leg shorter than the rest, or something, because it rattles now and then.

Lighthouse
You stand atop a pinnacle of stone, on an early Pharos, or lighthouse. Considerately enough, the builders have provided a spiral staircase down.

There seems to be very little traffic at the moment, though a smudge on the horizon might possibly be a quinquireme.

In the centre of the pinnacle is a marvellous device of polished bronze mirrors, its open end pointed out across the bay. The sun is rising and the sky is clear blue over the Mediterranean: it's going to be a beautiful day.

You hear a sharp click!

The flash suddenly gives an enormous magnesium-flare flash, almost blinding in its intensity. Your eyes take a little while to adjust. Consequently you can only hear as the smudge on the horizon rises from the waves, becomes an enormous Kraken sea monster and lunges for the stone tower. (Considering this is supposed to be a Greek myth it feels surprisingly like a Japanese 1960s creature film.)  The Kraken swipes at you, overreaches itself and falls over forward, impaling itself extremely messily on the pharos. Your eyes just about recover by the time the rest of your body is crushed by its weight.

Up on Mount Olympus, Zeus is still cross. "Take me to your Leda", you wittily demand, but this does not seem to improve matters. Poseidon also looks rather fed up, but luckily a sizeable faction of goddesses takes your side and arranges to have you resurrected...

Causeway
A warm winter's night in the ancient city of Alexandria, on the Heptastadion causeway across the harbour to the Island of Pharos (to north). The Mediterranean waters lap against the land bridge, and the whole city (southeast) is lit up with torches: it is a night of celebration.

Island of Pharos
The island of the Pharos: the lighthouse after which others are named, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, blazes into the sharp moonlit sky. It is 120 metres high, a circle on an octagon on a square.

A light wind blows across the coastal defences. On this spot, seventy-two scholars first translated the Old Testament into Greek: shivering continuously if it was as chilly as this. A narrow causeway runs south across the harbour.

In one wall of the wave defences is a rusty seaweed-wreathed iron grating, closed up tight.

Interestingly, a key which looks as if it would fit the grating can be seen inside the passage beneath.

Necropolis
A spacious, sombre, moonlit and magnificent valley of tombs, some brand new, just outside the walls of Alexandria (to the northeast). Already it is ancient. Most of the little termite-hill style pyramids have been invaded time after time: indeed, one pyramid's entrance gapes open to the south.

Bewilderingly, the condensation dissolves your hand away, and the water rushes up over your body as if it were blotting paper. You feel nothing except disorientation, but your confusion soon resolves to...

Inside the Orb
You half-stand, half-float in a golden, misty sphere perhaps ten yards across, which slowly spins. The centre, out of reach and somehow insubstantial, is an eight-by-eight lattice of oblong crystals, bathed in warm pearly light.

Images lurk about the array of oblong crystals.

The sphere rotates, giving you a fresh view of the images: stylised Kings and Queens?

>strike it

>point it at black
The White pieces advance: first a bishop, then a knight is sacrificed, clearing away the wall of pawns which surround the Black king so that a dazzling checkmate can be executed!

You fade out of the orb as oddly as you came, struck by the way it now almost pulsates in your palm.

Stone Cross
Beside the long triangle of the green, under the stone cross of the First World War memorial. The public footpath runs south to a stile. The village is tiny: the parish church, the "Goat and Compasses" pub (which, owing to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few houses and desultory tea-shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall.

The monkey sits on Evans' shoulder, cheeping with excitement. Evans has found a pet, and is so gruffly delighted that he has forgotten all about the mascot you stole. Now if he could only predict the 3.40 at Borchester Mills...

Old Evans, the village racing enthusiast, sits on the steps of the memorial, combing the back pages of his "Racing Times" newspaper.

Infinity Symbol
An eerie, dark cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and strewn with great spiders' webs hung from the ragged stone, inhabited only by dead white insects. A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the warmth of the house.

The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.

You shiver with foreboding, but inexplicably feel that the map you're looking for must be somewhere near here.

Murky Cave
This is a murky hillside cave, whose mouth opens to the northeast, though a tight squeeze might lead a little way west. Outside is a clear starry night. There is no traffic noise, and the air smells fresh.

Hanging up on an iron bracket is a flaming torch.

Spur of Rock
An uncomfortable spur of rock on the hillside crags. The only natural access to this spot is a crevice in the hill to the east, but there is also a securely fastened rope hanging down into the darkness.

Hanging on Rope
You are hanging perilously on a hemp rope, suspended from an overhang of rock above, which drops down into the darkness of the valley. On the tracks below, patrols of men can be heard, and you feel instinctively that they are not friendly.

A single yellow daisy grows from a little tuft of grass on the crags.

Valley Prospect
The geography is strangely familiar here. You are on a natural shelf on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all-but invisible cleft in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the east.

It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation.

>e

Roman Villa
You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a none-too-secure timber door.

>s

Atrium Cloister
The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a fieldmouse, and hear the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters in from the central courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back north.

Resting against one pillar is a horn made from a tusk, mounted on a long spear-like pole.

>get horn

Atrium
The central well of the villa, ringed with columns. On the north side is a cloister and stone-linteled doorways lead east, south and west. The central floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman mosaic, quartered into individual scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust. There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight.

>e

Guard Quarters
Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently home to military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough blankets which are little more than animal hides. Fortunately for you the guards are absent.

You can see a crude bone die and a pair of leather sandals here.

Entrance
A well-flagstoned forecourt at the villa entrance, surrounded by lesser wooden buildings. Some of these are in use as stables, and figures of men slip between them. You hide from sight, not wishing to draw attention to yourself. Up on the hill, where Meldrew Hall will one day be built, men on horseback can be seen circling the access track. For a deserted villa, this is certainly well-guarded.

From up on the hill you hear the blowing of a horn.

What was once the villa's triclinium, or kitchen, is now deserted and long since ransacked for metal. (Nobody lives on their own in this century, and this villa wouldn't be easy to defend.)  A doorway to the east gives onto the atrium.

In one corner is a hinged wooden cover of some kind, which is shut.

The sound of horses draws nearer.

Hypocaust
This very low almost-cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access space for log fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating for the villa. They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works.

A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof; just enough to see by. The only way in seems to be the way you came.

There is sudden activity as the guards make a thorough precautionary search of the villa. Luckily, they don't even think of looking down in here.

A voice, which can just be heard through the vent, says something in Anglo-Saxon or Celtic (hard to say which).

>point it at me
Nothing obvious happens. You curse eloquently in Celtic.

A younger, more impatient voice, says "This is an opportunity!  We must be the power behind the thrones, we will in secret unite and be the true force of the land..."

>z
Time passes.

There is cynical laughter for a moment, and a third voice interjects "And who will lead this, this unity?  We take all sides and none, you know that. There are potent druids in the tents of each general down there in the rabble. They'd kill each other in a second come the battle."

>z
Time passes.

The first voice speaks once more. "Far worse is to come. The jumped-up kings and their new men will no longer believe in the ancient powers. Already I can feel the druidic magic weakening away, and we are perilously close to the nexus now. In the valleys below, armies wait to fight the decisive battle. Whichever side wins, they will no longer need us. In a matter of hours, the power will be broken forever."

>z
Time passes.

After a sombre silence, a much older voice says "You did right to call us together. There is a path prepared for us, but the sacrifice will be terrible. We must concentrate all the remaining druidical energy into this sacred hill, that it may last through all time, and we must ensure that druids live on this site forever and keep the faith."

>z
Time passes.

The younger voice speaks again. "For now, yes, for a century or two, yes, but what then?  They will forget the old ways, they will no longer truly be druids."

>z
Time passes.

The older voice replies triumphantly. "This is what must be done. They will forget, so we must give them a substitute. We shall accurse them to always seek after this magical stone, which it will be all but impossible for them to find. It will take the form of whatever they most desire. In six hundred years, by my prophecy, religious wars in the East will capture men's hearts, and then they will think it is the Holy Grail, the cup which held the blood of Christ. A thousand years later they will think it is -"  But at this moment the voices move away.

Triclinium

The hinged wooden cover is raised, revealing a circular well about a yard in diameter. It is very dark inside.

An industrious-looking slave (who cooks for the horsemen) is rather surprised to see you, but with creditable presence of mind he summons the guard at once.

Suddenly you are thrust before a druidical figure. He seems to recognise you, and is troubled. Perhaps because of this, your life is saved and you are taken away into custody, down in the valley among the army encampments.

Rough Tent
Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent of stitched animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a central pole. You have no idea where the entrance is, because you were blindfolded on the way in. There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires outside the tent.

Without warning a Saxon spy (or, as the guards would no doubt put it, another Saxon spy) is thrown bodily into the tent, careering into the central pole and slumping unconscious on the ground as a result. For a moment the whole tent rocks with the force - the pole was nearly broken.

>get pole
As you uproot the tent-pole, the whole tent collapses ignominiously, the animal hides falling about your head. The hides are heavy and weigh you down, but you just manage to crawl out...

Encampment
Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched at all, because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried out over beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim.

Unreal City
This is a city side street, but as if seen through the grey of despair. People stream by, some of whom you almost recognise, as if dead. The street runs east-west, and to the north is a doorway into a grubby tenement building.
